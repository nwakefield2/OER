\typeout{************************************************}
\section[{Our Goals}]{Our Goals}\label{subsection-1}
\hypertarget{p-6}{}%
Several fundamental ideas in calculus are more than 2000 years old. As a formal subdiscipline of mathematics, calculus was first introduced and developed in the late 1600s, with key independent contributions from Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Mathematicians agree that the subject has been understood rigorously since the work of Augustin Louis Cauchy and Karl Weierstrass in the mid 1800s when the field of modern analysis was developed, in part to make sense of the infinitely small quantities on which calculus rests. As a body of knowledge, calculus has been completely understood for at least 150 years. The discipline is one of our great human intellectual achievements: among many spectacular ideas, calculus models how objects fall under the forces of gravity and wind resistance, explains how to compute areas and volumes of interesting shapes, enables us to work rigorously with infinitely small and infinitely large quantities, and connects the varying rates at which quantities change to the total change in the quantities themselves.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7}{}%
While each author of a calculus textbook certainly offers their own creative perspective on the subject, it is hardly the case that many of the ideas they present are new. Indeed, the mathematics community broadly agrees on what the main ideas of calculus are, as well as their justification and their importance; the core parts of nearly all calculus textbooks are very similar. As such, it is our opinion that in the 21st century and the age of the internet, no one should be required to purchase a calculus text to read, to use for a class, or to find a coherent collection of problems to solve. Calculus belongs to humankind, not any individual author or publishing company. Thus, a primary purpose of this work is to present a calculus text that is \emph{free}. In addition, instructors who are looking for a calculus text should have the opportunity to download the source files and make modifications that they see fit; thus this text is \emph{open-source}.%

Instructors and students alike will find several consistent features in the presentation, including: \leavevmode%
\begin{description}
\item[{Motivating Questions}]\hypertarget{li-1}{}\hypertarget{p-9}{}%
At the start of each section, we list 2\textendash{}3 \emph{motivating questions} that provide motivation for why the following material is of interest to us. One goal of each section is to answer each of the motivating questions.%
\item[{Graphics}]\hypertarget{li-2}{}\hypertarget{p-10}{}%
As much as possible, we strive to demonstrate key fundamental ideas visually, and to encourage students to do the same. Throughout the text, we use full-color\footnote{To keep cost low, the graphics in the print-on-demand version are in black and white. When the text itself refers to color in images, one needs to view the .html or .pdf electronically.\label{fn-1}} graphics to exemplify and magnify key ideas, and to use this graphical perspective alongside both numerical and algebraic representations of calculus.%
\item[{Summary of Key Ideas}]\hypertarget{li-3}{}\hypertarget{p-11}{}%
Each section concludes with a summary of the key ideas encountered in the preceding section; this summary normally reflects responses to the motivating questions that began the section.%

\typeout{************************************************}
\section[{The Definition of Function}]{The Definition of Function}\label{subsection-4}
\hypertarget{p-15}{}%
We often want to predict values of one variable from the values of a related variable. For a more extensive treatment of functions we refer the reader to \href{https://mathbooks.unl.edu/PreCalculus/introfunctions.html}{PreCalculus at Nebraska: Introduction to Functions}%
\begin{assemblage}[Definition of Function]\label{assemblage-1}
\hypertarget{p-16}{}%
A \terminology{function}\index{function} is a relationship between two variables for which a unique value of the \terminology{output}\index{output} variable can be determined from a value of the \terminology{input}\index{input} variable.%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-17}{}%
What distinguishes functions from other variable relationships? The definition of a function calls for a \emph{unique value} that is, \emph{exactly one value} of the output variable corresponding to each value of the input variable. This property makes functions useful in applications because they can often be used to make predictions.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-18}{}%
A function can be described in several different ways. In the following sections, we consider examples of functions defined by tables, by graphs, and by equations.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsection 1.2 Functions Defined by Tables}
\typeout{************************************************}
\section[{Functions Defined by Tables}]{Functions Defined by Tables}\label{subsection-5}
\hypertarget{p-19}{}%
When we use a table to describe a function, the first variable in the table (the left column of a vertical table or the top row of a horizontal table) is the input variable, and the second variable is the output. We say that the output variable \emph{is a function of} the input.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-table-functions}
\hypertarget{p-20}{}%
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
\item\hypertarget{li-4}{}\hypertarget{p-21}{}%
\hyperref[table-auto-sales]{Table~\ref{table-auto-sales}} shows data on sales compiled over several years by the accounting office for Eau Claire Auto Parts, a division of Major Motors. In this example, the year is the input variable, and total sales is the output. We say that total sales, \(S\), \emph{is a function of} \(t\).%
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{AcAcA}\hrulethick
Year \((t)\)&Total sales \((S)\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin

\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{table-auto-sales}}
\end{table}
\item\hypertarget{li-5}{}\hypertarget{p-22}{}%
\hyperref[table-postage]{Table~\ref{table-postage}} gives the cost of sending printed material by first-class mail in 2016.%
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{AcAcA}\hrulethick
Weight in ounces \((w)\)&Postage \((P)\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\(0 \lt w \le 1 \)&\textdollar{}0.47\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\(1 \lt w \le 2 \)&\textdollar{}0.68\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\(2 \lt w \le 3 \)&\textdollar{}0.89\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\(3 \lt w \le 4 \)&\textdollar{}1.10\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\(4 \lt w \le 5 \)&\textdollar{}1.31\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\(5 \lt w \le 6 \)&\textdollar{}1.52\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\(6 \lt w \le 7 \)&\textdollar{}1.73\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{table-postage}}
\end{table}
\hypertarget{p-23}{}%
If we know the weight of the article being shipped, we can determine the required postage from \hyperref[table-postage]{Table~\ref{table-postage}}. For instance, a catalog weighing 4.5 ounces would require \textdollar{}1.31 in postage. In this example, \(w\) is the input variable and \(p\) is the output variable. We say that \(p\) \emph{is a function of} \(w\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-6}{}\hypertarget{p-24}{}%
\hyperref[table-cholesterol]{Table~\ref{table-cholesterol}} records the age and cholesterol count for 20 patients tested in a hospital survey.%
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{AcAcAcAcAcA}\hrulethick
Age&Cholesterol count&&Age&Cholesterol count\tabularnewline\hrulethin
53&217&&\(51\)&\(209\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
48&232&&53&241\tabularnewline\hrulethin
55&198&&49&186\tabularnewline\hrulethin
56&238&&\(51\)&\(216\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\(51\)&\(227\)&&57&208\tabularnewline\hrulethin
52&264&&52&248\tabularnewline\hrulethin
53&195&&50&214\tabularnewline\hrulethin
47&203&&56&271\tabularnewline\hrulethin
48&212&&53&193\tabularnewline\hrulethin
50&234&&48&172\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{table-cholesterol}}
\end{table}
\hypertarget{p-25}{}%
According to these data, cholesterol count is \emph{not} a function of age, because several patients who are the same age have different cholesterol levels. For example, three different patients are 51 years old but have cholesterol counts of 227, 209, and 216, respectively. Thus, we cannot determine a \emph{unique} value of the output variable (cholesterol count) from the value of the input variable (age). Other factors besides age must influence a persons cholesterol count.%
\end{enumerate}

\section[{Functions Defined by Graphs}]{Functions Defined by Graphs}\label{subsection-6}
\hypertarget{p-26}{}%
A graph may also be used to define one variable as a function of another. The input variable is displayed on the horizontal axis, and the output variable on the vertical axis.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-sun-hours}
\hypertarget{p-27}{}%
\hyperref[fig-sun-hours]{Figure~\ref{fig-sun-hours}}  shows the number of hours, \(H\), that the sun is above the horizon in Peoria, Illinois, on day \(t\), where January 1 corresponds to \(t = 0\).%

\hyperref[example-falling-book]{Example~\ref{example-falling-book}} illustrates a function defined by an equation.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-falling-book}
\hypertarget{p-41}{}%
As of 2016,  One World Trade Center in New York City is the nations tallest building, at 1776 feet. If an algebra book is dropped from the top of One World Trade Center, its height above the ground after \(t\) seconds is given by the equation%
\begin{equation*}
h = 1776 - 16t^2
\end{equation*}
Thus, after \(1\) second the books height is%
\begin{equation*}
h = 1776 - 16(1)^2 = 1760 \text{ feet}
\end{equation*}
After \(2\) seconds its height is%
\begin{equation*}
h = 1776 - 16(2)^2 = 1712 \text{ feet}
\end{equation*}
For this function, \(t\) is the input variable and \(h\) is the output variable. For any value of \(t\), a unique value of \(h\) can be determined from the equation for \(h\). We say that \(h\) \emph{is a function of} \(t\).%

\section[{Function Notation}]{Function Notation}\label{subsection-8}
\hypertarget{p-42}{}%
There is a convenient notation for discussing functions. First, we choose a letter, such as \(f\), \(g\), or \(h\) (or \(F\), \(G\), or \(H\)), to name a particular function. (We can use any letter, but these are the most common choices.) For instance, the height, \(h\), of a falling textbook is a function of the elapsed time, \(t\). We might call this function \(f\). In other words, \(f\) is the name of the relationship between the variables \(h\) and \(t\). We write%
\begin{equation*}
h = f (t)
\end{equation*}
which means "\(h\) is a function of \(t\), and \(f\) is the name of the function."%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-falling-book-2}
\hypertarget{p-43}{}%
In \hyperref[example-falling-book]{Example~\ref{example-falling-book}}, the height of an algebra book dropped from the top of One World Trade Center is given by the equation%
\begin{equation*}
h = 1776 - 16t^2
\end{equation*}

Linear relationships are relationships in which the rate of change is constant. \begin{assemblage}[Linear Equation]\label{assemblage-3}
\hypertarget{p-62}{}%
A \terminology{linear function} is a function which has a \terminology{constant rate of change.}%
\end{assemblage}
 Many phenomena can be modeled using linear functions \(y = f (x)\) where the equations have the form%
\begin{equation*}
f (x) = (\text{starting value}) + (\text{rate of change}) \cdot x.
\end{equation*}
The initial value, or the value of \(f(0)\), is the vertical intercept of the graph, and the rate of change is the slope of the graph. Thus, we can write an equation of a line as%
\begin{equation*}
f (x) = b + mx
\end{equation*}
where the constant term, \(b\), is the vertical intercept of the line, and \(m\), the coefficient of \(x\), is the slope of the line. This form for an equation of a line is called the \terminology{slope-intercept form}\index{slope-intercept form}.%
\begin{assemblage}[Slope-Intercept Form]\label{assemblage-4}
\hypertarget{p-63}{}%
If we write an equation of a linear function in the form,%
\begin{equation*}
f (x) = mx + b
\end{equation*}
then \(m\) is the \terminology{slope}\index{slope} of the line, and \(b\) is the \terminology{vertical intercept}.%
\end{assemblage}

In the equation \(f (x) = mx + b\), we call \(m\) and \(b\) \terminology{parameters}\index{parameters}. Their values are fixed for any particular linear equation; for example, in the equation \(y = 2x + 3\), \(m = 2\) and \(b = 3\), and the variables are \(x\) and \(y\). By changing the values of \(m\) and \(b\), we can write the equation for any line except a vertical line (see \hyperref[fig-slope-vs-intercept]{Figure~\ref{fig-slope-vs-intercept}}).

\par

The inverse function \(f^{-1}\) undoes the effect of the function \(f\). The function \(f(t) = 6 + 2t\) multiplies the input by \(2\) and then adds \(6\) to the result. The inverse function \(f^{-1}(H) = \dfrac{H -6}{2}\) undoes those operations in reverse order: It subtracts \(6\) from the input and then divides the result by \(2\).%
\par

If we apply the function \(f\) to a given input value and then apply the function \(f^{-1}\) to the output from \(f\), the end result will be the original input value. For example, if we choose \(t = 5\) as an input value, we find that \begin{align*} f(5)\amp= 6 + 2(5) = 16\amp\amp\text{ Multiply by 2, then add 6.}\\ \text{and } f^{-1}(16) \amp = \frac{16 - 6}{2} = 5.\amp\amp\text{Subtract 6, then divide by 2.} \end{align*}%

\hypertarget{p-117}{}%
Before we discuss exponential functions, it is first useful to define the notion of concavity.%
\begin{assemblage}[Concavity]\label{assemblage-19}
\hypertarget{p-118}{}%
The graph of a function is concave up if it bends upward as we move left to right; it is concave down if it bends downward.  A line is neither concave up nor concave down.%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-119}{}%
An exponential function will be either be increasing or decreasing, but will always be concave up! We define such a function as follows:%
\begin{assemblage}[Exponential Function]\label{assemblage-20}
\hypertarget{p-120}{}%
%
\begin{equation*}
P(t) = a \cdot b^t \text{, where } b \gt 0 \text{ and } b \ne 1 \text{, } a \ne 0.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-121}{}%
The constant \(a \) is the \(y\)-value of the \(y\)-intercept of the function.%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-122}{}%
The equation%
\begin{equation*}
P(t)=P_0 a^t
\end{equation*}
gives an exponential function with base \(a\). Then%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{P(t+1)}{P(t)}=\frac{P_0 a^{t+1}}{P_0 a^t}=a =\text{constant rate of growth/decay}
\end{equation*}
\leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}Growth: \(a\gt1\): Doubling time: the time it takes to double the initial amount%
\item{}Decay \(0\lt a\lt1\): Half-life: the time it takes to decay to half of the initial amount%
\end{itemize}
%
\begin{assemblage}[Doubling Time and Half-life]\label{assemblage-21}
\hypertarget{p-123}{}%
The doubling time of an exponentially increasing quantity is the time required for the quantity to double. The half-life of an exponentially decaying quantity is the time required for the quantity to be reduced by a factor of one half.%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-124}{}%
We will (naturally) consider exponentials (and later, logarithms) in base%
\begin{equation*}
e \approx 2.718281828459... \text{ (irrational number)}
\end{equation*}
For example, the general exponential function in the natural base%
\begin{equation*}
P(t)=P_0 a^t=P_0 (e^k)^t=P_0e^{kt}, \quad a=e^k. 
\end{equation*}
Thus, we will have \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}exponential growth if \(a\gt 1\), which gives \(k\gt 0\)%
\item{}exponential decay if \(0\lt a\lt 1\), which gives \(k\lt 0\)%
\end{itemize}
 The number \(k\) is called \emph{the continuous rate of growth/decay.} To find \(k\) we will need the logarithmic function.%

Recall inverse functions.  If for each \(y\) in the range of \(f\) there exists exactly one value of \(x\) such that \(f(x)=y,\) then \(f\) has an inverse at \(y\) denoted by \(f^{-1}\) such that%
\begin{equation*}
f(x)=y \quad \iff \quad f^{-1}(y)=x
\end{equation*}
Hence%
\begin{equation*}
f(f^{-1}(y))=y \quad \text{and} \quad f^{-1}(f(x))=x.
\end{equation*}
The \emph{inverse} of the exponential function \(f(x)=e^x\) is the natural \emph{logarithmic} function \(f^{-1}(x)= \ln(x)\) so we have%
\begin{equation*}
\ln(x) =c \iff e^c=x  
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{assemblage}[The Logarithm]\label{assemblage-22}
\hypertarget{p-126}{}%
Let \(b\neq 1 \) be a positive number, then the function%
\begin{equation*}
f(t)=\log_b(t) 
\end{equation*}
is called a logarithm with base \(b \).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-127}{}%
Upon inputting a value \(t\), the function \(\log_b(t)\) will tell you the  power of \(b \) which will yield \(t \).%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-128}{}%
Due to the relationship between logarithms and exponentials, we often say that the equations%
\begin{equation*}
x=\log_b(y)\ \ \ \ \text{and}\ \ \ \ b^x=y
\end{equation*}
are equivalent.%
\begin{warning}[]\label{warning-1}
\hypertarget{p-129}{}%
Two common bases of a logarithm are base \(10 \) and \(e\). Since they are used so often, we have developed a short hand notation for a logarithm of base \(10\) and a logarithm of base \(e\). This short hand is shown below:%
\begin{equation*}
\log_{10}(y)=\log(y).
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
\log_{e}(y)=\ln(y).
\end{equation*}
In other words, we simply drop the subscript when referring to base \(10 \) and we change to \(\ln\) when referring to base \(e\)%

A \terminology{periodic function}\index{periodic function} is a function whose output values repeat on a regular interval. In mathematical terms, we say that a periodic function is a function for which a specific horizontal shift, \(P\), results in the original function: \(f(x+P)=f(x)\) for all values of \(x\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-139}{}%
The \terminology{period}\index{period} of a periodic function is how long it takes for the output values to begin repeating, or the smallest horizontal shift with \(P>0\), such that \(f(x+P)=f(x)\) for all values of \(x\).%

The London Eye is a huge Ferris wheel in London, England. It completes one full rotation every 30 minutes, and the diameter of its passenger capsules is 130 meters. Riders board the passenger capsules from a platform that is 5 meters above the ground. At time \(t=0\), an individual boards the Ferris wheel.%

\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-10}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-149}{}%
Let's start by drawing a picture of the Ferris wheel and labeling the known information.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-150}{}%
We know that at time \(t=0\) a rider boards the Ferris wheel from the boarding platform, which is 5 meters above the ground. We also know that the Ferris wheel has a diameter of 130 meters and it takes 30 minutes to complete one full revolution around the Ferris wheel.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-151}{}%
Since it takes 30 minutes to complete a trip around the Ferris wheel, a rider will reach the top of the Ferris wheel after 15 minutes (assuming that the wheel rotates at a constant speed). Similarly, the rider will reach the three o'clock and nine o'clock positions on the Ferris wheel at 7.5 minutes and 22.5 minutes.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-152}{}%
%
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/imagesChap13/LondonEyeSketch.png}
\hypertarget{p-153}{}%
Next, we can make a table of the rider's height above ground vs. time.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-154}{}%
At time \(t=0\), the rider is at the boarding platform, which corresponds to a height of 5 meters above ground. After 15 minutes, the rider reaches the top of the Ferris wheel, which corresponds to a height of 135 meters above ground. We can find this height by taking the height of the boarding platform plus the diameter of the Ferris wheel.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-155}{}%
We can also find an intermediate height corresponding to when the rider has been on the Ferris wheel for 7.5 minutes and 22.5 minutes. At these two positions, the rider is halfway between the top of the Ferris wheel and the boarding platform. We can find this height by adding the height of the boarding platform to the radius of the Ferris wheel. Therefore, we get a height of \(5+65 = 70\) meters above ground at these two times.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-156}{}%
After 30 minutes, the rider is back at the boarding platform, which corresponds to a height of 5 meters above ground. If the individual were to continue riding the Ferris wheel, this pattern of heights would continue and we could extend our table with additional times and heights as shown below.%

Now that we have a table of times and corresponding heights, we can plot these points and draw a smooth curve between them to create a height vs. time graph.%

Note that in this example, we assumed that the Ferris wheel was rotating counterclockwise, as shown in our sketch above. For this problem, it did not matter what direction the Ferris wheel was rotating because both clockwise and counterclockwise rotation would have produced the same height vs. time graph. However, this will not always be the case. If the rider were to start in the three o'clock or nine o'clock position, we would need to know whether the Ferris wheel was turning clockwise or counterclockwise in order to sketch a graph of the rider's height above ground.%

By definition, the period of the function is how long it takes for the function to start repeating. If we think about the function "starting" at \(x=0\), or when it crosses the \(y\)-axis, we can see that it begins repeating when \(x=4\). Therefore, the period of the function is 4.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-166}{}%
The midline of the function is the horizontal line halfway between the function's maximum and minimum values. Here, the maximum value of the function is 5 and the minimum value is 1. To find the number halfway between 5 and 1, we can take the average of the two numbers. The average of 5 and 1 is%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{5+1}{2} = 3
\end{equation*}
Thus, the midline of the function is the line \(y=3\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-167}{}%
The amplitude of the function is the distance between the function's maximum value and the midline. We can find this value by subtracting the midline from the maximum value. Therefore, the amplitude of this function is \(5 - 3 = 2\).%

While measuring angles in degrees may be familiar to many students, doing so often complicates matters since the units of measure can get in the way of calculations. For this reason, another measure of angles is commonly used. This measure is based on the distance around the unit circle.%

\hypertarget{p-171}{}%
The \terminology{unit circle}\index{unit circle} is a circle of radius 1, centered at the origin of the \(xy\)-plane. When measuring an angle around the unit circle, we travel in the counterclockwise direction, starting from the positive \(x\)-axis. A negative angle is measured in the opposite, or clockwise, direction. A complete trip around the unit circle amounts to a total of 360 degrees.%

Radians are a \terminology{unitless measure}. Therefore, it is not necessary to write the label "radians" after a radian measure, and if you see an angle that is not labeled with "degrees" or the degree symbol, you should assume that it is a radian measure.%

\hypertarget{p-176}{}%
Radians and degrees both measure angles. Thus, it is possible to convert between the two. Since one rotation around the unit circle equals 360 degrees or \(2\pi\) radians, we can use this as a conversion factor.%

Since \(x=-0.4\) does not correspond to a common angle on the unit circle, we need to use a calculator to solve for an approximate value of \(\theta\). Applying the inverse cosine function we get that%
\begin{equation*}
\theta = \cos^{-1}(-0.4)
\end{equation*}
To evaluate this, we can use our calculator. Since the output of the inverse function is an angle, our calculator will give us an angle in degrees if it is in \terminology{degree mode} or an angle in radians if it is in \terminology{radian mode}.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-248}{}%
Here, we need to decide whether to provide our answer in degrees or radians. Since we are given the interval \([0,2\pi]\), which is radians, we will provide our answers in radians. Using our calculator in \terminology{radian mode} we get that%
\begin{equation*}
\theta \approx 1.982 \text{ radians}
\end{equation*}
We have now found one angle in the interval \([0,2\pi]\) such that \(\cos(\theta) = -0.4\). However, as shown above, \(\theta\) could lie in either Quadrant II or Quadrant III. Since 1.982 is bigger than \(\frac{\pi}{2} \approx 1.571\) and smaller than \(\pi \approx 3.142\), we know that \(\theta=1.982\) lies in Quadrant II. Therefore, we have found the angle shown below.%

An easy way to check our solutions is to evaluate \(\cos(1.982)\) and \(\cos(4.301)\) on our calculators. If our calculator returns values close to \(-0.4\), then we know the angles we have found are correct. Using our calculator (in radian mode), we get%
\begin{equation*}
\cos(1.982)=-0.3997 \hspace{.25in} \text{ and } \hspace{.25in} \cos(4.301)=-0.3999
\end{equation*}
Since both of these values are very close and round to -0.4, we can be confident that we have found the two angles in the interval \([0,2\pi]\) that satisfy \(\cos(\theta)=-0.4\).%

\hypertarget{p-254}{}%
Since we are given a tangent value, we know that we are looking for angles where \(\frac{y}{x}=7\) on the unit circle. In addition, our tangent value is positive, so this means that \(\theta\) must lie in Quadrant I, where both \(x\) and \(y\) are positive, or in Quadrant III, where both \(x\) and \(y\) are negative.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-255}{}%
Since \(\tan(\theta)=7\) does not correspond to a common angle on the unit circle, we need to use a calculator to solve for an approximate value of \(\theta\). Applying the inverse tangent function we get that%
\begin{equation*}
\theta = \tan^{-1}(7)
\end{equation*}
Using our calculator in \terminology{radian mode} we get that%
\begin{equation*}
\theta \approx 1.429 \text{ radians}
\end{equation*}
We have now found one angle in the interval \([0,2\pi]\) such that \(\tan(\theta) = 7\). However, from our work above, we know that \(\theta\) could lie in either Quadrant I or Quadrant III. Since 1.429 is bigger than 0 and smaller than \(\frac{\pi}{2} \approx 1.571\), we know that \(\theta=1.429\) lies in Quadrant I. Therefore, we have found the angle shown below.%

Like all functions, trigonometric functions can be transformed by changing properties like the period, midline, and amplitude of the function. In this subsection, we explore transformations of the sine and cosine functions and use them to model real life situations.%

\hypertarget{p-270}{}%
\(|A| \ \) is the vertical stretch/compression and the \terminology{amplitude} of the function.%

\hypertarget{p-274}{}%
To begin, let's find the period, midline, and amplitude of the function.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-275}{}%
Using the relationships above, the stretch/compression factor is \(|B|=|2|\). Therefore, the period is%
\begin{equation*}

\end{equation*}

\hypertarget{p-276}{}%
The vertical stretch/compression factor is \(|A|=|3|=3\), so the amplitude is 3.%

Using our knowledge of the graph of \(f(t)=\sin(t)\), we can sketch a transformed graph of \(g(t)=3\sin(2t)+4\). Note that the period, midline and amplitude of both functions is different. Thus, the graph of \(g(t)=3\sin(t)+4\) involves a vertical shift up by 4, a vertical stretch of 3, and a horizontal compression by a factor of \(\frac{1}{2}\) from the original graph of \(f(t)=\sin(t)\).

\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-23}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-287}{}%
To begin, let's find the period, midline, and amplitude of the function graphed above.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-288}{}%
Recall that the period of the function is how long it takes for the function to start repeating. If we think about the function "starting" at \(x=0\), or when it crosses the \(y\)-axis, we can see that the function above begins repeating when \(x=5\). Therefore, the period of the function graphed above is 5.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-289}{}%
Since the period of a function is related to \(B\), the stretch/compression factor, we can use the relationship \(P = \frac{2\pi}{|B|}\) to solve for \(B\). Substituting 5 in for \(P\), we get%
\begin{align*}
5 \amp= \frac{2\pi}{|B|} \\
\\
|B| \cdot 5 \amp= 2\pi \\
\\
|B| \amp= \frac{2\pi}{5} 
\end{align*}
For now, we can assume that the \(B\) value is positive, which gives us%
\begin{equation*}
B = \frac{2\pi}{5} 
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-290}{}%
The midline of the function is the horizontal line halfway between the function's maximum and minimum values. Here, the maximum value of the function is 4 and the minimum value is 0. The number halfway between 4 and 0 is 2, so the midline is the line \(y=2\). Therefore, the vertical shift of the function graphed above is%
\begin{equation*}
k=2
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-291}{}%
Finally, the amplitude of the function is the distance between the function's maximum value and the midline. The distance between the function's maximum value of 4 and the function's midline of \(y=2\) is 2, so the amplitude of the function above is 2. Therefore, the vertical stretch factor is%
\begin{equation*}
|A|=2
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-292}{}%
We now need to decide what type of sinusoidal function to use and whether \(A\) is positive or negative. Note that the function shown above crosses the \(y\)-axis at its minimum value. Therefore, from our work above, we need to use a vertical reflection of a cosine graph to model this function, which means that%
\begin{equation*}
A=-2
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-293}{}%
Using our work above and substituting our known values into the generalized cosine function \(g(t)=A\cos(Bt) + k\) gives us the following formula for the function graphed above.%
\begin{equation*}
f(t) = -2\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{5}t\right) + 2
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-294}{}%
To check our solution, we can use a graphing calculator to graph the function we came up with and confirm that it matches the graph shown above.%

Riders board the passenger capsules from a platform that is 5 meters above the ground. At time \(t=0\), an individual boards the Ferris wheel.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-296}{}%
Find a formula for \(h=f(t)\), where \(h\) is the height of the individual above ground (in meters) after \(t\) minutes.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-24}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-297}{}%
Recall that in the London Eye example, we sketched a graph of \(h=f(t)\) for the situation described above. This graph is shown below.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-298}{}%
%
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/imagesChap13/LondonEyeGraph.png}
\hypertarget{p-299}{}%
Since we have already sketched a graph of this function, we can use this graph to construct a formula for this function.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-300}{}%
As shown on the graph, the period of the function is 30 minutes. Therefore, the \(B\) value of the function is%
\begin{equation*}
|B| = \frac{2\pi}{P} = \frac{2\pi}{30} = \frac{\pi}{15}
\end{equation*}
Again, we assume that \(B\) is positive, so%
\begin{equation*}
B=\frac{\pi}{15}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-301}{}%
The maximum value of the function is 135 meters and the minimum value is 5 meters. The midline is halfway in between these two values and can be found by averaging them:%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{135+5}{2} = \frac{140}{2} = 70 \text{ meters}
\end{equation*}
Thus, the midline of the function is the line \(y=70\) meters, and%
\begin{equation*}
k=70
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-302}{}%
The amplitude of the function is the distance between the maximum value and the midline which is \(135-70=65\) meters. Therefore,%
\begin{equation*}
|A|=65
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-303}{}%
Finally, we need to determine what type of function to use and whether the \(A\) value is positive or negative. Since the graph of the function crosses the \(y\)-axis at its minimum value, we can use a negative cosine graph to represent this function. Therefore,%
\begin{equation*}
A=-65
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-304}{}%
Using our work above and substituting our known values into the generalized cosine function \(g(t)=A\cos(Bt) + k\) gives us the following formula for \(h=f(t)\)%
\begin{equation*}
f(t) = -65\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{15}t\right) + 70
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-305}{}%
To check our solution, we can use a graphing calculator to graph the function we came up with and confirm that it matches the graph shown above.%

What does it mean to say that a function \(f\) is continuous at \(x = a\)?%

\end{itemize}
\end{objectives}
\hypertarget{p-308}{}%
In this section we introduce the idea of a continuous function. Many of the results in calculus require that the functions be continuous, so having a strong understanding of continuous functions will be very important.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsection 1.1.1 Being Continuous at a Point}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[{Being Continuous at a Point}]{Being Continuous at a Point}\label{subsection-20}
\index{continuous}\hypertarget{p-309}{}%
Intuitively, a function is continuous if we can draw its graph without ever lifting our pencil from the page. Alternatively, we might say that the graph of a continuous function has no jumps or holes in it.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/1_7_Cont.pdf}
\caption{Functions \(f\), \(g\), and \(h\) that demonstrate subtly different behaviors at \(a = 1\).\label{figure-10}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-310}{}%
First consider the function in the left-most graph above. Note that \(f(1)\) is not defined, which leads to the resulting hole in the graph of \(f\) at \(a = 1\). If you were to draw the graph of \(f\) yourself then you would need to lift your pencil when you reached \(f(1)\). We will naturally say that \(f\) is \emph{not continuous at \(a = 1\)}. For the function \(g\), we observe that while \(g(1)\) is defined, the value of \(g(1) = 2\) is not what you would ``expect.''  Specifically, you would expect \(g(1)\) to be 3, not 2. Thus, to draw the graph of \(g\) you would need to lift your pencil at \(a=1\). Again, we will say that \(g\) is \emph{not continuous} at \(a=1\), even though the function is defined at \(a = 1\). Finally, the function \(h\) appears to be the most ``well-behaved'' of all three, since at \(a = 1\) the function value is what you might expect it to be if you were to try and draw the graph of the function without lifting your pencil.  In this case we would say that \(h\) is continuous at \(a=1\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-311}{}%
The above examples demonstrate a discontinuity commonly know as a \emph{removable discontinuity}. This is, however, not the only way in which a function can be discontinuous.  Another type of discontinuity is the so-called \emph{jump} discontinuity illustrated below.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/Piecewise.jpg}
\caption{Places where functions make a ``jump'' also produce discontinuities.\label{figure-11}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-312}{}%
A third type of discontinuity is the so-called \emph{infinite} discontinuity.  Infinite discontinuities exist at points where the values of a function diverge to infinity.  A classic example of an infinite discontinuity is the point \(x=0\) for the function \(f(x)=\frac{1}{x}\); you can see the behavior of the infinite discontinuity in the graph of \(y=f(x)\) below.%
\begin{figure}

\hypertarget{p-315}{}%
\(f(x)\) is discontinuous at \(x=4, -4\); however, the discontinuity at \(x=-4\) is removable.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-25}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-316}{}%
We first consider a graph of \(y=f(x)\), shown below.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/0-4-rational.jpg}
\caption{A plot of the function \(y=f(x)\).\label{figure-14}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-317}{}%
Visual inspection of the graph certainly indicates discontinuities.  However, we can make our visual inspection more precise through a little algebra.  We start by expanding the numerator and denominator of the function.  Specifically, we have%
\begin{equation*}
f(x)=\frac{3x(x+4)}{x^2-16}=\frac{3x(x+4)}{(x+4)(x-4)}.
\end{equation*}
From here we see that there are two \(x\)-values at which the function is undefined: at \(x=-4,4\). Since the term \(x+4\) occurs in both the numerator and denominator, the point \(x=-4\) is a removable discontinuity. Since the term \(x-4\) occurs only in the denominator, \(x=4\) is an infinite discontinuity.%

\subsection[{The Intermediate Value Theorem}]{The Intermediate Value Theorem}\label{subsection-22}
\hypertarget{p-335}{}%
Up to this point we have talked about the continuity of a function at a point. Before stating the Intermediate Value Theorem we begin by defining a continuous function. We will formalize this definition in \hyperref[lims]{Section~\ref{lims}} with the introduction of limits.%
\begin{assemblage}[Continuous Function]\label{assemblage-37}

A function is said to be \terminology{continuous on an interval \((a,b)\)} if the function has no points of discontinuity on that interval.%

One of the most important theorems in Calculus is the Intermediate Value Theorem.  The Intermediate Value Theorem essentially says that a continuous function takes the value of any points that it crosses.  The formal statement of the theorem follows.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-339}{}%
\index{intermediate value theorem} \begin{assemblage}[Intermediate Value Theorem]\label{assemblage-38}
\hypertarget{p-340}{}%
Suppose \(f\) is continuous on a closed interval \([a,b]\). If \(k\) is any number between \(f(a)\) and \(f(b)\), then there is at least one number \(c\) in \([a,b]\) such that \(f(c)=k\).%
\end{assemblage}
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-35}
\hypertarget{p-341}{}%
Amber measures herself before going to bed and is 67 inches tall. She measures herself again when she wakes up 8 hours later, and is now 68 inches tall. Let \(h(t)\) be Amber's height in inches \(t\) hours after the first measurement. Then \(h(0)=67\) and \(h(8)=68\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-342}{}%
Do you think there is a time between when Amber goes to bed and when she wakes up that she is 67.5 inches tall?%
\par
\hypertarget{p-343}{}%
Since Amber is likely growing continuously (i.e., she did not jump from 67 inches to 68 inches instantly), the Intermediate Value Theorem holds for the height function \(h(t)\). The Intermediate Value Theorem states that at some time while Amber slept, she measured 67.5 inches tall.%
\end{example}
\begin{example}[]\label{example-36}
\hypertarget{p-344}{}%
Consider the function \(f(x)=x^3-3x^2+3x-4\). Use the Intermediate Value Theorem to show that \(f(x)\) has a root between \(x=2\) and\(x=3\).%

\hypertarget{p-345}{}%
We want to show that there is some number \(c\) between 2 and 3 such that \(f(c)=0\). We consider the value of the function \(f\) at \(x=2\) and \(x=3\):%
\begin{equation*}
f(2)=8-12+6-4=-2\lt 0
\end{equation*}
and%
\begin{equation*}
f(3)=27-27+9-4=5\gt 0.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-346}{}%
Thus \(f(2)\lt 0\lt f(3)\); in other words, 0 is a number between \(f(2)\) and \(f(3)\). The function \(f\) is a polynomial, so it is a continuous function. Thus the Intermediate Value Theorem says there is a number \(c\) between 2 and 3 such that \(f(c)=0\). In other words, \(f\) has a root \(c\) in the interval \((2,3)\).%

\hypertarget{p-353}{}%
Limits are a mathematical construct we can use to describe the behavior of a function near a point.  Consider the function \(g\) given by the graph in \hyperref[F-1-2-PA1]{Figure~\ref{F-1-2-PA1}} below. We can evaluate the function at a variety of points.  For example, \(g(-2)=0\), \(g(-1)=3\), and \(g(0)=1\).%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.47\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/1_2_PA1.pdf}
\caption{Graph of \(y = g(x)\).\label{F-1-2-PA1}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-354}{}%
A careful look at the graph above shows that \(g\) has a removable discontinuity at \(x=0\), making \(g(0)=1\) even though the overall shape of the graph might lead us to expect \(g(0)\) to be \(4\). In fact, you would probably agree that ``as \(x\) gets closer and closer (but NOT equal) to \(0\), \(g(x)\) gets as close as we want to \(4\).'' This is the basic idea of a limit and we will expand on this idea in the following section.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsection 1.2.1 The Notion of Limit}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[{The Notion of Limit}]{The Notion of Limit}\label{subsection-23}
\hypertarget{p-355}{}%
Limits give us a way to identify a trend in the values of a function as its input variable approaches a particular value of interest. We need a precise understanding of what it means to say ``a function \(f\) has limit \(L\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\).''%
\par
\hypertarget{p-356}{}%
In \hyperref[F-1-2-PA1]{Figure~\ref{F-1-2-PA1}}, we saw that as \(x\) gets closer and closer (but NOT equal) to 0, \(g(x)\) gets as close as we want to the value 4. At first, this may feel counterintuitive, because the value of \(g(0)\) is \(1\), not \(4\). Limits describe the behavior of a function \emph{arbitrarily close to} a fixed input and are not affected by the value of the function \emph{at} the fixed input. More formally,\footnote{What follows here is not what mathematicians consider the formal definition of a limit. To be completely precise, it is necessary to quantify both what it means to say ``as close to \(L\) as we like'' and ``sufficiently close to \(a\).'' That can be accomplished through what is traditionally called the epsilon-delta definition of limits. That being said, the definition presented here is sufficient for the purposes of this text.\label{fn-2}} we say the following.%
\begin{assemblage}[Limit of a Function]\label{assemblage-39}
\hypertarget{p-357}{}%
If a function \(f\) is defined on an interval around \(c\), except perhaps at the point \(x = c\),  we define the \terminology{limit of the function \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(c\)} to be a number \(L\) (if one exists) such that \(f(x)\) is as close to  \(L\) as we want whenever \(x\) is sufficiently close to \(c\) (but \(x \neq c\)). If \(L\) exists, we write%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x)=L\text{.}
\end{equation*}
On the other hand, if as \(x\) approaches \(c\) we cannot make \(f(x)\) as close to a single value as we would like, then we say that \terminology{\(f\) does not have a limit as \(x\) approaches \(c\)}.%
\end{assemblage}
\begin{example}[]\label{example-37}
\hypertarget{p-358}{}%
Recall the function \(g\) from the section introduction, whose graph is reproduced below. \begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.47\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/1_2_PA1.pdf}
\caption{Graph of \(y = g(x)\)\label{F-1-2-PA1prime}}
\end{figure}
 For the function \(g\) pictured in \hyperref[F-1-2-PA1prime]{Figure~\ref{F-1-2-PA1prime}}, we make the following observations:%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to -1} g(x) = 3, \  \lim_{x \to 0} g(x) = 4, \ \text{and}  \  \lim_{x \to 2} g(x) = 1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
When finding a limit from a graph, it suffices to ask if the function \emph{approaches} a single value from each side of the fixed input. The function value \emph{at} the fixed input is irrelevant. This reasoning explains the values of the three limits stated above.%

We further observe that \(g\) does not have a limit as \(x\) approaches \(1\) because there is a jump in the graph at \(x = 1\). If we approach \(x = 1\) from the left, the function values tend to get close to 3, but if we approach \(x = 1\) from the right, the function values get close to 2. There is no single number that all of these function values approach. This is why the limit of \(g\) does not exist at \(x = 1\).%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-360}{}%
For any function \(f\), there are typically three ways to answer the question ``does \(f\) have a limit at \(x = a\), and if so, what is the limit?'' The first is to reason graphically. If we have a formula for \(f(x)\), there are two additional possibilities: \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*]
\item\hypertarget{li-55}{}Evaluate the function at a sequence of inputs that approach \(a\) on either side (typically using some sort of computing technology), and ask if the sequence of outputs seems to approach a single value.%
\item\hypertarget{li-56}{}Use the algebraic form of the function to understand the trend in its output values as the input values approach \(a\).%
\end{enumerate}
 The first approach produces only an approximation of the value of the limit, while the latter can often be used to determine the limit exactly.%
\begin{example}[]\label{Ex-1-2-Limits}
\hypertarget{p-361}{}%
For each of the following functions, we'd like to know whether or not the function has a limit at the stated \(c\)-values. Use both numerical and algebraic approaches to investigate and, if possible, estimate or determine the value of the limit. Compare the results with a careful graph of the function on an interval containing the points of interest.%

From \hyperref[table-1-F-1-2-Ex1f]{Table~\ref{table-1-F-1-2-Ex1f}}, it appears that we can make \(f\) as close as we want to 3 by taking \(x\) sufficiently close to \(-1\), which suggests that \(\lim_{x \to -1} f(x) = 3\). This is also consistent with the graph of \(y=f(x)\) seen in \hyperref[plot-F-1-2-Ex1f]{Figure~\ref{plot-F-1-2-Ex1f}}. To see this a bit more rigorously and from an algebraic point of view, consider the formula for \(f\): \(f(x) = \frac{4-x^2}{x+2}\). As \(x\) approaches \(-1\), the numerator, \(4-x^2\), of \(f\) approaches \(4 - (-1)^2 = 3\), and the denominator, \(x+2\), of \(f\) approaches \(-1 + 2 = 1\). Hence \(\lim_{x \to -1} f(x) = \frac{3}{1} = 3\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-365}{}%
The situation is more complicated when \(x\) approaches \(-2\) because \(f(-2)\) is not defined. If we try to use a similar algebraic argument regarding the numerator and denominator, we observe that as \(x\) approaches \(-2\), the numerator \((4-x^2)\) approaches \((4 - (-2)^2) = 0\), and the denominator \((x+2)\) approaches \((-2 + 2) = 0\), so as \(x\) approaches \(-2\), the numerator and denominator of \(f\) both tend to 0. We call \(\frac{0}{0}\) an \terminology{indeterminate form}. \index{limit!indeterminate form} This tells us that there is somehow more work to do. From \hyperref[table-2-F-1-2-Ex1f]{Table~\ref{table-2-F-1-2-Ex1f}} and \hyperref[plot-F-1-2-Ex1f]{Figure~\ref{plot-F-1-2-Ex1f}}, it appears that \(f\) should have a limit of \(4\) at \(x = -2\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-366}{}%
To see algebraically why this is the case, observe that%
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x \to -2} f(x) = \amp  \lim_{x \to -2} \frac{4-x^2}{x+2}\\
= \amp  \lim_{x \to -2} \frac{(2-x)(2+x)}{x+2}\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-367}{}%
It is important to observe that because we are taking the limit as \(x\) approaches \(-2\), we are considering \(x\) values that are close, but not equal, to \(-2\). Since we never actually allow \(x\) to equal \(-2\), the quotient \(\frac{2+x}{x+2}\) has value 1 for every possible value of \(x\). Thus, we can simplify the most recent expression above, and find that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to -2} f(x) = \lim_{x \to -2} (2-x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
This limit is now easy to determine, and its value is \(4\). Thus, from several points of view we've seen that \(\lim_{x \to -2} f(x) = 4\).%

b. Next we turn to the function \(g\), and construct two tables and a graph.%

First, as \(x\) approaches \(3\), it appears from the values in \hyperref[table-1-F-1-2-Ex1g]{Table~\ref{table-1-F-1-2-Ex1g}} that the function is approaching a number between \(0.86601\) and \(0.86604\). From the graph in \hyperref[plot-F-1-2-Ex1g]{Figure~\ref{plot-F-1-2-Ex1g}} it appears that \(g(x)\) approaches \(g(3)\) as \(x\) approaches \(3\). The exact value of \(g(3) = \sin(\frac{\pi}{3})\) is \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), which is approximately 0.8660254038. This is convincing evidence that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to 3} g(x) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-370}{}%
As \(x\) approaches \(0\), we observe that \(\frac{\pi}{x}\) does not behave in an elementary way. When \(x\) is positive and approaching zero, we are dividing by smaller and smaller positive values, and \(\frac{\pi}{x}\) increases without bound. When \(x\) is negative and approaching zero, \(\frac{\pi}{x}\) decreases without bound. In this sense, as we get close to \(x = 0\), the inputs to the sine function are growing rapidly, and this leads to increasingly rapid oscillations in the graph of \(g\) between \(1\) and \(-1\). If we plot the function \(g(x) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{x}\right)\) with a graphing utility and then zoom in on \(x = 0\), we see that the function never settles down to a single value near the origin, which suggests that \(g\) does not have a limit at \(x = 0\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-371}{}%
How do we reconcile the graph in \hyperref[plot-F-1-2-Ex1g]{Figure~\ref{plot-F-1-2-Ex1g}} with \hyperref[table-2-F-1-2-Ex1g]{Table~\ref{table-2-F-1-2-Ex1g}}, which seems to suggest that the limit of \(g\) as \(x\) approaches \(0\) may in fact be \(0\)? The data misleads us because of the special nature of the sequence of input values \(\{0.1, 0.01, 0.001, \ldots\}\). When we evaluate \(g(10^{-k})\), we get \(g(10^{-k}) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{10^{-k}}\right) = \sin(10^k \pi) = 0\) for each positive integer value of \(k\). But if we take a different sequence of values approaching zero, say \(\{0.3, 0.03, 0.003, \ldots\}\), then we find that%
\begin{equation*}
g(3 \cdot 10^{-k}) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{3 \cdot 10^{-k}}\right) = \sin\left(\frac{10^k \pi}{3}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866025\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-372}{}%
That sequence of function values suggests that the value of the limit is \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). Clearly the function cannot have two different values for the limit, so \(g\) has no limit as \(x\) approaches \(0\).%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-373}{}%
An important lesson to take from \hyperref[Ex-1-2-Limits]{Example~\ref{Ex-1-2-Limits}} is that tables can be misleading when determining the value of a limit. While a table of values is useful for investigating the \emph{possible} value of a limit, we should also use other tools to confirm the value.%
\begin{example}[]\label{act-1-2-1}
\hypertarget{p-374}{}%
Estimate the value of each of the following limits by constructing appropriate tables of values. Then determine the exact value of the limit by using algebra to simplify the function. Finally, plot each function on an appropriate interval to check your result visually. \leavevmode%

\hypertarget{p-379}{}%
We saw earlier that \(f\) has limit \(L\) as \(x\) approaches \(c\) provided that we can make the value of \(f(x)\) as close to \(L\) as we like by taking \(x\) sufficiently close (but not equal to) \(c\). If so, we write \(\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L\). We also saw that there are cases where a function can fail to have a limit.  The graphs that follow are two such examples.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/1_7_NoLimit.pdf}
\caption{Functions \(f\) and \(g\) that each fail to have a limit at \(c = 1\).\label{F-1-7-NoLimit}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-380}{}%
Essentially there are two behaviors that a function can exhibit near a point where it fails to have a limit. In \hyperref[F-1-7-NoLimit]{Figure~\ref{F-1-7-NoLimit}} above, at the left we see a function \(f\) whose graph shows a jump at \(c = 1\). If we let \(x\) approach 1 from the left side, the value of \(f\) approaches 2, but if we let \(x\) approach \(1\) from the right, the value of \(f\) tends to 3. Because the value of \(f\) does not approach a single number as \(x\) gets arbitrarily close to 1 from both sides, we know that \(f\) does not have a limit at \(c = 1\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-381}{}%
For such cases, we introduce the notion of \emph{left} and \emph{right} (or \emph{one-sided}) limits. \index{limit!left-hand} \index{limit!right-hand} \index{limit!one-sided}%
\begin{assemblage}[One-Sided Limits]\label{assemblage-40}
\hypertarget{p-382}{}%
We say that \(f\) has limit \(L_1\) as \(x\) approaches \(c\) from the left and write%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to c^-} f(x) = L_1
\end{equation*}
provided that we can make the value of \(f(x)\) as close to \(L_1\) as we like by taking \(x\) sufficiently close to \(c\) while always having \(x \lt  c\). We call \(L_1\) the \terminology{left-hand limit} of \(f\) as \(x\) approaches \(c\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-383}{}%
Similarly, we say \(L_2\) is the \terminology{right-hand limit} of \(f\) as \(x\) approaches \(c\) and write%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to c^+} f(x) = L_2
\end{equation*}
provided that we can make the value of \(f(x)\) as close to \(L_2\) as we like by taking \(x\) sufficiently close to \(c\) while always having \(x \gt c\).%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-384}{}%
In the graph of \(y=f(x)\) in \hyperref[F-1-7-NoLimit]{Figure~\ref{F-1-7-NoLimit}}, we see that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to 1^-} f(x) = 2 \ \ \text{and}  \ \lim_{x \to 1^+} f(x) = 3\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Precisely because the left and right limits are not equal, the overall limit of \(f\) as \(x \to 1\) fails to exist.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-385}{}%
For the function \(g\) pictured at the right of \hyperref[F-1-7-NoLimit]{Figure~\ref{F-1-7-NoLimit}}, the function fails to have a limit at \(c = 1\) for a different reason. While the function does not have a jump in its graph at \(c = 1\), it is still not the case that \(g\) approaches a single value as \(x\) approaches 1. In particular, due to the infinitely oscillating behavior of \(g\) to the right of \(c = 1\), we say that the (right-hand) limit of \(g\) as \(x \to 1^+\) does not exist, and thus \(\lim_{x \to 1} g(x)\) does not exist.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-386}{}%
To summarize, if either a left- or right-hand limit fails to exist or if the left- and right-hand limits are not equal to each other, the overall limit does not exist.%
\begin{assemblage}[Two-Sided Limit]\label{limit-left-right}
\hypertarget{p-387}{}%
A function \(f\) has limit \(L\) as \(x \to c\) if and only if%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to c^-} f(x) = L = \lim_{x \to c^+} f(x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-388}{}%
That is, a function has a limit at \(x = c\) if and only if both the left- and right-hand limits at \(x = c\) exist and have the same value.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-389}{}%
The function \(f\) given below in \hyperref[F-1-7-PA1]{Figure~\ref{F-1-7-PA1}} fails to have a limit at only two values: at \(c = -2\) (where the left- and right-hand limits are 2 and \(-1\), respectively) and at \(x = 2\), where \(\lim_{x \to 2^+} f(x)\) does not exist). Note well that even at values such as \(c = -1\) and \(c = 3\) where there are holes in the graph, the limit still exists.%

\subsection[{Limits and Continuity}]{Limits and Continuity}\label{subsection-25}
\hypertarget{p-414}{}%
Recall that informally we said a function is continuous if we can draw its graph without ever lifting our pencil from the page.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/1_7_Cont.pdf}
\caption{Functions \(f\), \(g\), and \(h\) that demonstrate subtly different behaviors at \(c = 1\).\label{F-1-7-Cont}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-415}{}%
\index{continuous!connection to limits} Using limits, we can formalize the idea of continuity. First consider the function in the left-most graph of \hyperref[F-1-7-Cont]{Figure~\ref{F-1-7-Cont}} above. Note that \(f(1)\) is not defined, which leads to the resulting hole in the graph of \(f\) at \(c = 1\). We will naturally say that \(f\) is \emph{not continuous at \(c = 1\)}. For the function \(g\), we observe that while \(\lim_{x \to 1} g(x) = 3\), the value of \(g(1)\) is \(2\), and thus the limit does not equal the function value. Here, too, we will say that \(g\) is \emph{not continuous}, even though the function is defined at \(c = 1\). Finally, the function \(h\) appears to be the most well-behaved of all three, since at \(c = 1\) its limit and its function value agree. That is,%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to 1} h(x) = 3 = h(1)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-416}{}%
With no hole or jump in the graph of \(h\) at \(c = 1\), we say that \(h\) is \emph{continuous} there. More formally, we make the following definition.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-417}{}%
\index{continuous!at \(x = c\)} \begin{assemblage}[Continuous Function]\label{assemblage-42}
\hypertarget{p-418}{}%
A function \(f\) is \terminology{continuous at \(x = c\)} provided that \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-91}{}\hypertarget{p-419}{}%
\(f\) has a limit as \(x \to c\),%
\item\hypertarget{li-92}{}\hypertarget{p-420}{}%
\(f\) is defined at \(x = c\), and%
\item\hypertarget{li-93}{}\hypertarget{p-421}{}%
\(\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)\).%
\end{enumerate}
%
\end{assemblage}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-422}{}%
Conditions (a) and (b) are technically contained implicitly in (c), but we state them explicitly to emphasize their individual importance. The definition says that a function is continuous at \(x = c\) provided that its limit as \(x \to c\) exists and equals its function value at \(x = c\). If a function is continuous at every point in an interval \([a,b]\), we say the function is ``continuous on \([a,b]\).'' If a function is continuous at every point in its domain, we simply say the function is ``continuous.'' Thus we note that continuous functions are particularly nice: to evaluate the limit of a continuous function at a point, all we need to do is evaluate the function.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-423}{}%
For example, consider \(p(x) = x^2 - 2x + 3\). It can be proved that every polynomial is a continuous function at every real number, and thus if we would like to know \(\lim_{x \to 2} p(x)\), we simply compute%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to 2} (x^2 - 2x + 3) = 2^2 - 2 \cdot 2 + 3 = 3 = p(2)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-424}{}%
This route of substituting an input value to evaluate a limit works whenever we know that the function being considered is continuous. Besides polynomial functions, all exponential functions and the sine and cosine functions are continuous at every point, as are many other familiar functions and combinations thereof.%

\item\hypertarget{li-100}{}We can examine the graph of \(y=f(x)\) at \(x=2\) or examine function values nearby \(x=2\) on the left and right to find that \(\lim_{x\to 2} f(x)=0\). Evaluating \(f(2)=\ln(3-2)=\ln(1)=0\). Thus, \(\lim_{x\to2}f(x)=f(2)\), and \(f\) is continuous at \(x=2\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-101}{}Notice that the graph of \(g\) has a vertical asymptote at \(x=2\), so \(g(2)\) is undefined. Hence, \(g\) is not continuous at \(x=2\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-102}{}For values of \(x\) near 2 (from the left and right), we have \(h(x)\) getting close to 5. Therefore, \(\lim_{x\to2}h(x)=5\). However, \(h(2)=3\). Since \(\lim_{x\to2}h(x)\neq h(2)\), \(h\) is not continuous at \(x=2\).%

\hypertarget{p-436}{}%
The concepts discussed in the last two sections will be important in later sections. The following is a short summary of these sections and an example that ties together the concepts of limits and continuity. \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}For a function \(f\) defined on an interval around a number \(c\),%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x)=L
\end{equation*}
means that the value of \(f(x)\) gets as close as we want to a number \(L\) whenever \(x\) is sufficiently close to \(c\), assuming the value \(L\) exists.%
\item{}We define a limit from the left and a limit from the right in the same way as above, while adding the stipulation that \(x\lt c\) for the left limit and \(x\gt c\) for the right limit. That is, as we move \(x\) sufficiently close to \(c\) \emph{from the left} on a number line (\(x\lt c\)), \(f(x)\) gets as close to the limit value as we want. Similarly for the limit from the right.%
\item{}The one-sided limits help to determine if a limit exists as \(x\) approaches a value \(c\). More specifically, \(\lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x)=L\) if and only if \(\lim_{x \rightarrow c^-} f(x)=L=\lim_{x \rightarrow c^+} f(x)\)%
\item{}Limits also help us determine the continuity of a function at a point \(x=c\). A function \(f\) that has a limit as \(x\rightarrow c\), is defined at \(x=c\), and \(\lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x)=f(c)\) is continuous at \(x=c\).%

At \(c = -1\), note that \(\lim_{x \to -1} f(x)\) exists (and appears to have value approximately \(-3.25\)), but \(f(-1) = 1\) and thus \(\lim_{x \to -1} f(x) \ne f(-1)\).

\item\hypertarget{li-135}{}\hypertarget{p-460}{}%
Based on our work in (a), (b), and (c), \(f\) is not continuous at \(c=-2\) and \(c = 2\) because \(f\) does not have a limit at those points; \(f\) is not continuous at \(c = 3\) since \(f\) is not defined there; and \(f\) is not continuous at \(c = -1\) because at that point its limit does not equal its function value.%

``If \(f\) \emph{is continuous} at \(x = c\), then \(f\) \emph{has a limit} at \(x = c\),'' since one of the defining properties of ``being continuous'' at \(x = c\) is that the function has a limit at that input value. This shows that being continuous is a stronger condition than having a limit.%

In the denominator we have the corresponding time values \(t=1\) and \(t=0.5\), both measured in seconds. The units of the quotient, then, should be feet per second. These are units of velocity, and in fact the value of \(AV_{[0.5,1]}\) is the average velocity on the time interval \(0.5\le t\le1\).

\subsection[{Position and Average Velocity}]{Position and Average Velocity}\label{subsection-28}
\hypertarget{p-477}{}%
The \emph{position} \index{position} of any moving object can be considered as a function of \emph{time}. When the motion is along a straight line, the position is given by a single variable, which we denote by \(s(t)\). For example, \(s(t)\) might give the mile marker of a car traveling on a straight highway at time \(t\) in hours. Similarly, the function \(s(t)\) described in \hyperref[PA-1-1]{Example~\ref{PA-1-1}} is a position function, where the position of a ball is measured vertically relative to the ground.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-478}{}%
On any time interval, a moving object also has an \emph{average velocity}. For example, to compute a car's average velocity we divide the number of miles traveled by the time elapsed, which gives the velocity in \emph{miles per hour}. Similarly, the value of \(AV_{[0.5,1]}\) in \hyperref[PA-1-1]{Example~\ref{PA-1-1}} gave the average velocity of the ball on the time interval \([0.5,1]\), measured in feet per second.%
\par

For an object moving in a straight line with position function \(s(t)\), the \terminology{average velocity of the object on the interval from \(t = a\) to \(t = b\)} is denoted \(AV_{[a,b]}\) and given by the formula%
\begin{equation*}
AV_{[a,b]} = \frac{s(b)-s(a)}{b-a}\text{.}

\subsection[{Instantaneous Velocity}]{Instantaneous Velocity}\label{subsection-29}
\hypertarget{p-504}{}%
Whether we are driving a car, riding a bike, or throwing a ball, we have an intuitive sense that a moving object has a velocity at any given moment --- a number that measures how fast the object is moving \emph{right now}. For instance, a car's speedometer tells the driver the car's velocity at any given instant. In fact, the velocity on a speedometer is really an average velocity that is computed over a very small time interval. If we let the time interval over which average velocity is computed become shorter and shorter, we can progress from average velocity to \emph{instantaneous} velocity.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-505}{}%
Informally, we define the instantaneous velocity \index{instantaneous velocity} of a moving object at time \(t = a\) to be the value that the average velocity approaches as we take smaller and smaller intervals of time containing \(t = a\). We will develop a more formal definition of instantaneous velocity soon, and this definition will be the foundation of much of our work in calculus. For now, it is fine to think of instantaneous velocity as follows: take average velocities on smaller and smaller time intervals around a specific point. If those average velocities approach a single number, then that number will be the instantaneous velocity at that point.%

We are interested in computing average velocities on the interval \([a,b]\) for smaller and smaller intervals. In order to make the link between average and instantaneous velocity more formal, think of the value \(b\) as \(b = a + h\), where \(h\) is a small (non-zero) number that is allowed to vary. Then the average velocity of the object on the interval \([a,a+h]\) is%
\begin{equation*}
AV_{[a,a+h]} = \frac{s(a+h)-s(a)}{h}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
with the denominator being simply \(h\) because \((a+h) - a = h\). Note that when \(h \lt  0\), \(AV_{[a,a+h]}\) measures the average velocity on the interval \([a+h,a]\).%
\par

To find the instantaneous velocity at \(t = a\), we investigate what happens as the value of \(h\) approaches zero.%

\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
\item\hypertarget{li-193}{}We make the assumptions that \(-0.5 \lt  h \lt  0.5\) and \(h \ne 0\) because \(h\) cannot be zero (otherwise there is no interval on which to compute average velocity) and because the function only makes sense on the time interval \(0 \le t \le 1\), as this is the duration of time during which the ball is falling. We want to compute and simplify%
\begin{equation*}
AV_{[0.5, 0.5+h]} = \frac{s(0.5+h) - s(0.5)}{(0.5+h) - 0.5}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
We start by finding \(s(0.5+h)\). To do so, we follow the rule that defines the function \(s\).%
\begin{align*}
s(0.5+h) \amp  =  16 - 16(0.5 + h)^2\\
\amp  =  16 - 16(0.25 + h + h^2)\\
\amp  =  16 - 4 - 16h - 16h^2\\
\amp  =  12 - 16h - 16h^2\text{.}
\end{align*}
Now, returning to our computation of the average velocity, we find that%
\begin{align*}
AV_{[0.5, 0.5+h]} \amp  =  \frac{s(0.5+h) - s(0.5)}{(0.5+h) - 0.5}\\
\amp  =  \frac{(12 - 16h - 16h^2) - (16 - 16(0.5)^2)}{0.5 + h - 0.5}\\
\amp  =  \frac{12 - 16h - 16h^2 - 12}{h}\\
\amp  =  \frac{-16h - 16h^2}{h}\text{.}
\end{align*}
At this point, we note two things: first, the expression for average velocity clearly depends on \(h\), which it must, since as \(h\) changes the average velocity will change. Further, we note that since \(h\) can never equal zero, we may remove the common factor of \(h\) from the numerator and denominator. It follows that%
\begin{equation*}
AV_{[0.5, 0.5+h]} = -16 - 16h\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-194}{}From this expression we can compute the average velocity on \([0.5,0.5+h]\) for any small positive or negative value of \(h\). For instance, to obtain the average velocity on \([0.5,0.75]\), we let \(h = 0.25\), and the average velocity is \(-16 - 16(0.25) = -20\) ft/sec. To get the average velocity on \([0.4, 0.5]\), we let \(h = -0.1\), and compute the average velocity as%
\begin{equation*}
-16 - 16(-0.1) = -14.4\ \text{ft/sec}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-195}{}Using our formula from (a), we can explore what happens to \(AV_{[0.5, 0.5+h]}\) as \(h\) gets closer and closer to zero. As \(h\) approaches zero, \(-16h\) will also approach zero, so it appears that the instantaneous velocity of the ball at \(t = 0.5\) should be \(-16\) ft/sec.%

For the function \(s(t) = 64 - 16(t-1)^2\) from \hyperref[PA-1-1]{Example~\ref{PA-1-1}}, find the most simplified expression you can for the average velocity of the ball on the interval \([2, 2+h]\). Use your result to compute the average velocity on \([1.5,2]\) and to estimate the instantaneous velocity at \(t = 2\). Finally, compare this to your earlier work in \hyperref[act-1-1-2]{Example~\ref{act-1-1-2}}.%
\par\smallskip%

\hypertarget{p-535}{}%
Note that%
\begin{align*}
s(2+h) \amp = 64 - 16(2+h-1)^2 = 64 - 16(1+h)^2\\
\amp = 64 - (16 + 32h + 16h^2) = 48 - 32h - 16h^2\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Answer.}\hypertarget{answer-12}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-536}{}%
\(AV_{[2, 2+h]} = -32 - 16h\), so \(AV_{[1.5,2]}=-24\) ft/sec. The instantaneous velocity at \(t=2\) is \(-32\) ft/sec.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-38}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-537}{}%
Observe first that%
\begin{align*}
s(2+h) \amp = 64 - 16(2+h-1)^2 = 64 - 16(1+h)^2\\
\amp = 64 - (16 + 32h + 16h^2) = 48 - 32h - 16h^2\text{.}
\end{align*}
Next, recall that \(AV_{[2, 2+h]} = \frac{s(2+h) - s(2)}{h}\), so%
\begin{equation*}
AV_{[2, 2+h]} = \frac{s(2+h) - s(2)}{h} = \frac{(48 - 32h - 16h^2)-48}{h} = \frac{-32h - 16h^2}{h}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-538}{}%
Now, since we assume \(h \ne 0\), we can simplify further to find that \(AV_{[2, 2+h]} = -32 - 16h\). Setting \(h = -0.5\), it follows that \(AV_{[1.5,2]} = -32 + 16(0.5) = -24\) ft/sec. Likewise, as we let \(h\) approach zero, we see that \(-32 - 16h\) will approach \(-32\), so the instantaneous velocity at \(t = 2\) appears to be \(-32\) ft/sec. Both results match our earlier work in \hyperref[act-1-1-2]{Example~\ref{act-1-1-2}}.%

\item\hypertarget{li-211}{}\hypertarget{p-557}{}%
On the time interval \([0,4]\) the jumper has the greatest change in position over that period of time, so it is on that interval that her average velocity is greatest in magnitude (but negative in sign). For the same reasons, the largest (positive) average velocity will occur on the interval \([4,8]\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-212}{}\hypertarget{p-558}{}%
We can approximate the jumper's average velocity on the intervals \([4.9,5]\) and \([5,5.1]\) and find the average of these average velocities. This will give us the slope of the secant line connecting the points \((4.9, s(4.9))\) and \((5.1, s(5.1))\) and be a reasonably good approximation to the instantaneous velocity at \(t = 5\). Now%
\begin{align*}
AV_{[4.9,5]} &= \frac{s(5)-s(4.9)}{5-4.9} \approx  21.31\\
AV_{[5,5.1]} &= \frac{s(5.1)-s(5)}{5.1-5} \approx  22.25

\hypertarget{p-594}{}%
The \emph{instantaneous rate of change} of a function is an idea that sits at the foundation of calculus. It is a generalization of the notion of instantaneous velocity and measures how fast a particular function is changing at a given point. If the original function represents the position of a moving object, this instantaneous rate of change is precisely the velocity of the object. In other contexts, instantaneous rate of change could measure the number of cells added to a bacteria culture per day, the number of additional gallons of gasoline consumed upon increasing a car's velocity by one mile per hour, or the number of dollars added to a mortgage payment for each percentage point increase in interest rate. The instantaneous rate of change can also be interpreted geometrically on the function's graph, and this connection is fundamental to many of the main ideas in calculus.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-595}{}%
Recall that for a moving object with position function \(s\), its average velocity on the time interval \(t = a\) to \(t = a+h\) is given by the quotient%
\begin{equation*}
AV_{[a,a+h]} = \frac{s(a+h)-s(a)}{h}\text{.}
\end{equation*}

Just as we defined instantaneous velocity in terms of average velocity, we now define the instantaneous rate of change of a function at a point in terms of the average rate of change of the function \(f\) over related intervals. This instantaneous rate of change of \(f\) at \(a\) \index{instantaneous rate of change} is called ``the \emph{derivative} of \(f\) at \(a\),'' and is denoted by \(f'(a)\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-611}{}%
\index{derivative!definition} \begin{assemblage}[Derivative at a Point]\label{def-derivative}
\hypertarget{p-612}{}%
Let \(f\) be a function and \(x = a\) a value in the function's domain. The \terminology{derivative of \(f\) with respect to \(x\) evaluated at \(x = a\)}, denoted \(f'(a)\), is defined by the formula%
\begin{equation*}
f'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
provided this limit exists.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-613}{}%
This is sometimes referred to as the ``limit definition'' of the derivative at a point.%
\end{assemblage}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-614}{}%
Aloud, we read the symbol \(f'(a)\) as either ``\(f\)-prime of \(a\)'' or ``the derivative of \(f\) evaluated at \(x = a\).'' The next several chapters will be devoted to understanding, computing, applying, and interpreting derivatives. For now, we observe the following important things.%
\begin{note}[]\label{note-5}
\hypertarget{p-615}{}%
\leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}The derivative of \(f\) at the value \(x = a\) is defined as the limit of the average rate of change of \(f\) on the interval \([a,a+h]\) as \(h \to 0\). This limit depends on both the function \(f\) and the point \(x=a\). Since this limit may not exist, not every function has a derivative at every point.%
\item{}We say that a function is \emph{differentiable} \index{differentiable} at \(x = a\) if it has a derivative at \(x = a\).%
\item{}The derivative is a generalization of the instantaneous velocity of a position function: if \(y = s(t)\) is the position function of a moving object, \(s'(a)\) tells us the instantaneous velocity of the object at time \(t=a\).%
\item{}Because the units of \(\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}\) are ``units of \(f(x)\) per unit of \(x\),'' the derivative has these same units. For instance, if \(s\) measures position in feet and \(t\) measures time in seconds, the units on \(s'(a)\) are feet per second.%
\item{}The quantity \(\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}\) represents the slope of the line through \((a,f(a))\) and \((a+h, f(a+h))\). When we compute the derivative, we are actually taking the limit of a collection of slopes of lines. Thus, the derivative itself represents the slope of a particularly important line.%
\end{itemize}
%
\end{note}
\hypertarget{p-616}{}%
We first consider the derivative at a given value as the slope of a certain line at that value.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-617}{}%
When we compute an instantaneous rate of change, we allow the interval \([a,a+h]\) to shrink as \(h \to 0\). We can think of one endpoint of the interval as ``sliding towards'' the other. In particular, provided that \(f\) has a derivative at \((a,f(a))\), the point \((a+h,f(a+h))\) will approach \((a,f(a))\) as \(h \to 0\). Because the process of taking a limit is a dynamic one, it can be helpful to use computing technology to visualize it.\footnote{One option is a Java applet in which the user is able to control the point that is moving. For a helpful collection of examples, consider the \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/5r}{work of David Austin} of Grand Valley State University, and \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/5s}{this particularly relevant example}. For applets that have been built in Geogebra,\footnote{You can even consider building your own examples; the fantastic program Geogebra is available for \href{http://geogebra.org}{free download} and is easy to learn and use.\label{fn-4}} see \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/5p}{Marc Renault's library} via Shippensburg University, with \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/5q}{this example} being especially fitting for our work in this section.\label{fn-3}}%

\hyperref[F-1-3-SecToTanSeq]{Figure~\ref{F-1-3-SecToTanSeq}} below shows a sequence of figures with several different lines through the points \((a, f(a))\) and \((a+h,f(a+h))\), generated by different values of \(h\). These lines (shown in the first three figures in magenta), are often called \emph{secant lines} \index{secant line} to the curve \(y = f(x)\). A secant line to a curve is simply a line that passes through two points on the curve. For each such line, the slope of the secant line is \(m = \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}\), where the value of \(h\) depends on the location of the point we choose. We can see in the diagram how, as \(h \to 0\), the secant lines start to approach a single line that passes through the point \((a,f(a))\). If the limit of the slopes of the secant lines exists, we say that the resulting value is the slope of the \emph{tangent line} to the curve. This tangent line \index{tangent line} (shown in the right-most figure in green) to the graph of \(y = f(x)\) at the point \((a,f(a))\) has slope \(m = f'(a)\).%

If the tangent line at \(x = a\) exists, the graph of \(f\) looks like a straight line when viewed up close at \((a,f(a))\).

Note how the tangent line sits relative to the curve \(y = f(x)\) at \((a,f(a))\), and how closely it resembles the curve near \(x = a\).%

The instantaneous rate of change of \(f\) with respect to \(x\) at \(x = a\), which is the derivative value \(f'(a)\), also measures the slope of the tangent line to the curve \(y = f(x)\) at \((a,f(a))\).%

The following example demonstrates several key ideas involving the derivative of a function.%
\begin{example}[Using the limit definition of the derivative]\label{example-50}
\hypertarget{p-622}{}%
For the function \(f(x) = x - x^2\), use the limit definition of the derivative to compute \(f'(2)\). In addition, discuss the meaning of this value and draw a labeled graph that supports your explanation.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Hint.}\hypertarget{hint-15}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-623}{}%
The definition of the derivative of \(f\) with respect to \(x\) evaluated at \(x=a\) says%
\begin{equation*}
f'(a)=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
How does the value you find for \(f'(2)\) manifest in the graph of \(f(x)=x-x^2\), particularly near the point \((2,f(2))\)?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Answer.}\hypertarget{answer-17}{}\quad%
%
\begin{equation*}
f'(2)=-3.
\end{equation*}
\hypertarget{p-624}{}%
The slope of the tangent line to \(f\) through the point \((2,-2)\) is \(-3\).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-43}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-625}{}%
From the limit definition, we know that%
\begin{equation*}
f'(2) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(2+h)-f(2)}{h}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-626}{}%
Now we use the rule for \(f\), and observe that \(f(2) = 2 - 2^2 = -2\) and \(f(2+h) = (2+h) - (2+h)^2\). Substituting these values into the limit definition, we have that%
\begin{equation*}
f'(2) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(2+h) - (2+h)^2 -  (-2)}{h}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-627}{}%
In order to evaluate the limit, we must simplify the quotient. Expanding and distributing in the numerator gives us%
\begin{equation*}
f'(2) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{2+h - 4 - 4h - h^2 + 2}{h}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-628}{}%
Combining like terms, we have%
\begin{equation*}
f'(2) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{ -3h - h^2}{h}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-629}{}%
Next, because \(h\neq0\) within the limit, we may remove a common factor of \(h\) in both the numerator and denominator and find that%
\begin{equation*}
f'(2) = \lim_{h \to 0} (-3-h)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-630}{}%
Finally, we are able to take the limit as \(h\) approaches \(0\), and thus conclude that \(f'(2) = -3\). We note that \(f'(2)\) is the instantaneous rate of change of \(f\) at the point \((2,-2)\). It is also the slope of the tangent line to the graph of \(y = x - x^2\) at the point \((2,-2)\). \hyperref[F-1-3-Ex1]{Figure~\ref{F-1-3-Ex1}} below shows both the function and the line through \((2,-2)\) with slope \(m = f'(2) = -3\).%

\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}The average rate of change of a function \(f\) on the interval \([a,b]\) is \(\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\). The units on the average rate of change are units of \(f(x)\) per unit of \(x\), and the numerical value of the average rate of change represents the slope of the secant line between the points \((a,f(a))\) and \((b,f(b))\) on the graph of \(y = f(x)\). If we view the interval as being \([a,a+h]\) instead of \([a,b]\), the meaning is still the same, but the average rate of change is now computed by \(\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}\).%
\item{}The instantaneous rate of change with respect to \(x\) of a function \(f\) at a value \(x = a\) is denoted \(f'(a)\) (read ``the derivative of \(f\) evaluated at \(a\)'' or ``\(f\)-prime of \(a\)'') and is defined by the formula%
\begin{equation*}
f'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
provided this limit exists. Note particularly that the instantaneous rate of change at \(x = a\) is the limit of the average rate of change on \([a,a+h]\) as \(h\) approaches \(0\).%
\item{}Provided the derivative \(f'(a)\) exists, its value tells us the instantaneous rate of change of \(f\) with respect to \(x\) at \(x = a\), which geometrically is the slope of the tangent line to the curve \(y = f(x)\) at the point \((a,f(a))\). We even say that \(f'(a)\) is the ``slope of the curve'' at the point \((a,f(a))\).%
\item{}Limits allow us to move from the rate of change over an interval to the rate of change at a single point.%

\hypertarget{p-679}{}%
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-359}{}\hypertarget{p-680}{}%
First, \(P(7)-P(0) = 115(1.014)^7-115(1.014)^0 \approx 0.1175\) billion people is the total population change. It follows that the average rate of change over this time period is \(AV_{[0,7]}=\frac{0.1175}{7} \approx 0.01679\) billion people per year. The instantaneous rate of change of the population at \(t = 7\) is%
\begin{equation*}
P'(7) = \lim_{h \to 0} AV_{[7,7+h]} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{115(1.014)^{7+h}-115(1.014)^7}{h}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and approximating this quantity with small values of \(h\), it follows that \(P'(7) \approx 0.1762\). Hence, the instantaneous rate of change at \(t = 7\) is greater than the average rate of change of \(P\)on the interval \([0,7]\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-360}{}\hypertarget{p-681}{}%
Using the formula for average rate of change,%
\begin{equation*}
AV_{[19,29]}=\frac{1.15(1.014)^{29}-1.15(1.014)^{19}}{29-19} \approx 0.02234
\end{equation*}
billion people/year.%
\item\hypertarget{li-361}{}\hypertarget{p-682}{}%
We will say that today's date is July 1, 2015, which means that \(t = 22.5\), so we want to compute \(P'(22.5)\). The limit definition tells us that%
\begin{equation*}
P'(22.5) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{115(1.014)^{22.5+h}-115(1.014)^{22.5}}{h}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Estimating this limit by using small values of \(h\), we determine that \(P'(22.5) \approx 0.02186\), which is measured in billions of people per year.%
\item\hypertarget{li-362}{}\hypertarget{p-683}{}%
We want the equation of the tangent line that has slope \(P'(22.5) \approx 0.02186\) and that passes through the point \((22.5, P(22.5))\). Using point-slope form, it follows that the line is given by%

Compare your findings among all three approaches; if you are unable to complete the algebraic approach, still work numerically and graphically.%

Finally, we verify these approximations using an algebraic approach. The definition of the derivative of \(f\) at \(x=a\) shows that%
\begin{align*}
f'(1) &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(1+h)-f(1)}{h}\\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sqrt{1+h}-\sqrt{1}}{h}\\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sqrt{1+h}-1}{h}\\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sqrt{1+h}-1}{h} \left(\frac{\sqrt{1+h}+1}{\sqrt{1+h}+1} \right)\\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(1+h)-1}{h(\sqrt{1+h}+1)}\\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{h}{h(\sqrt{1+h}+1)}\\
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+h}+1}\\
&= \frac{1}{2}\text{.}

Now we verify these approximations using an algebraic approach. Notice first that%
\begin{align*}
\frac{f(1+h)-f(1)}{h} &= \frac{[2-|(1+h)-1|] - 2}{h}\\
&= \frac{(2-|h|)-2}{h}\\
&= \frac{-|h|}{h}
\end{align*}
The definition of the absolute value function tells us that \(|h| = h\) whenever \(h \ge 0\), while \(|h| = -h\) whenever \(h \lt 0\). Thus, for \(h \gt 0\), we have%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{f(1+h)-f(1)}{h} = \frac{-|h|}{h} = -\frac{h}{h} = -1
\end{equation*}
and for \(h \lt 0\), we have%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{f(1+h)-f(1)}{h} = \frac{-|h|}{h} = -\frac{-h}{h} = 1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
This confirms that \(\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(1+h)-f(1)}{h}\) does not exist.%

Finally, we attempt to verify these approximations using an algebraic approach. Notice first that%
\begin{align*}
\frac{f(\frac{\pi}{2}+h)-f(\frac{\pi}{2})}{h} &= \frac{\sin(\frac{\pi}{2}+h) - \sin \frac{\pi}{2}}{h}\\
&= \frac{\sin(\frac{\pi}{2}+h) - 1}{h}
\end{align*}
Using the sum of two angles identity for the sine function, it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
\sin(\frac{\pi}{2}+h) = \sin \frac{\pi}{2} \cos(h) + \cos \frac{\pi}{2} \sin(h) =  1 \cdot \cos(h) + 0 \cdot \sin(h) =  \cos(h)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Hence,%
\begin{align*}
f'(\frac{\pi}{2}) &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(\frac{\pi}{2}+h)-f(\frac{\pi}{2})}{h}\\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\cos(h) - 1}{h}
\end{align*}
At this point, we encounter a limit that we are unable to evaluate further using algebraic means. Like the earlier limit above, we can estimate the limit using small values of \(h\). Doing so confirms that this limit also approaches \(0\), and we hence conclude that \(f'(\frac{\pi}{2}) = 0\).%

%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]

How does the limit definition of the derivative of a function \(f\) lead to an entirely new (but related) function \(f'\)?%

\end{itemize}
\end{objectives}
\hypertarget{p-713}{}%
We now know that the instantaneous rate of change of a function \(f(x)\) at \(x = a\), or equivalently the slope of the tangent line to the graph of \(y = f(x)\) at \(x = a\), is given by the value \(f'(a)\). In all of our examples so far, we have identified a particular value of \(a\) as our point of interest: \(a = 1\), \(a = 3\), etc. But it is not hard to imagine that we will often be interested in the derivative value for more than just one \(a\)-value, and possibly for many of them. In this section, we explore how we can move from computing the derivative at a single point to computing a formula for \(f'(a)\) at any point \(a\). Indeed, the process of ``taking the derivative'' generates a new function, denoted by \(f'(x)\), derived from the original function \(f(x)\).%

Observe that the work to find \(f'(a)\) is the same, regardless of the value of \(a\). Based on your work in (a), what do you conjecture is the value of \(f'(4)\)? How about \(f'(5)\)? (Note: you should \emph{not} use the limit definition of the derivative to find either value.)%
\item\hypertarget{li-384}{}\hypertarget{p-717}{}%
Conjecture a formula for \(f'(a)\) that depends only on the value \(a\). That is, in the same way that we have a formula for \(f(x)\) (recall \(f(x) = 4x - x^2\)), see if you can use your work above to guess a formula for \(f'(a)\) in terms of \(a\).%

\item\hypertarget{li-392}{}In part (a), each time we increased the input value by \(1\), the derivative value decreased by \(2\). This leads us to believe that \(f'(4)=-4\) and \(f'(5)=-6\), assuming the linear pattern continues.%

\subsection[{How the Derivative is Itself a Function}]{How the Derivative is Itself a Function}\label{subsection-33}
\hypertarget{p-721}{}%
In your work in \hyperref[PA-1-4]{Example~\ref{PA-1-4}} with \(f(x) = 4x - x^2\), you may have found several patterns. One comes from observing that \(f'(0) = 4\), \(f'(1) = 2\), \(f'(2) = 0\), and \(f'(3) = -2\). That sequence of values leads us naturally to conjecture that \(f'(4) = -4\) and \(f'(5) = -6\). We also observe that the particular value of \(a\) has very little effect on the process of computing the value of the derivative through the limit definition. To see this more clearly, we compute \(f'(a)\) where \(a\) is a variable \textemdash{} that is, \(a\) represents a number to be named later. Following the now standard process of using the limit definition of the derivative,%
\begin{align*}
f'(a) =\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h} \\
= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{4(a + h) - (a + h)^2 - (4a-a^2)}{h}\\
=\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{4a + 4h - a^2 - 2ha - h^2 - 4a+a^2}{h} \\
= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{4h - 2ha - h^2}{h}\\
=\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{h(4 - 2a - h)}{h} \\
=  \lim_{h \to 0} (4 - 2a - h)\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-722}{}%
Here we observe that neither \(4\) nor \(2a\) depend on the value of \(h\), so as \(h\) tends to \(0\), the quantity \((4 - 2a - h)\) approaches \((4 - 2a)\). Thus \(f'(a) = 4 - 2a\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-723}{}%
This result is consistent with the specific values we found above: e.g., \(f'(3) = 4 - 2(3) = -2\). And indeed, our work confirms that the value of \(a\) has almost no bearing on the process of computing the derivative. We note further that the letter being used is immaterial: whether we call it \(a\), \(x\), or anything else, the derivative at a given value is simply given by ``4 minus 2 times the value.'' We choose to use \(x\) for consistency with the original function given by \(y = f(x)\), as well as for the purpose of graphing the derivative function. For the function \(f(x) = 4x - x^2\), it follows that \(f'(x) = 4 - 2x\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-724}{}%
Because the value of the derivative function is linked to the graph of the original function, it makes sense to look at both of these functions plotted on the same domain.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.74\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/1_4_ffprimeplot.pdf}
\caption{The graphs of \(y=f(x)\) (at left) with \(f(x) = 4x - x^2\), and of \(y=f'(x)\) (at right), where \(f'(x) = 4 - 2x\). Slopes on the graph of \(y=f(x)\) correspond to \(y\)-coordinates on the graph of \(y=f'(x)\).\label{F-1-4-ffprime}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-725}{}%
The left half of \hyperref[F-1-4-ffprime]{Figure~\ref{F-1-4-ffprime}} above shows a plot of \(y=f(x)\), where \(f(x) = 4x - x^2\), together with a selection of tangent lines at the points we considered in \hyperref[PA-1-4]{Example~\ref{PA-1-4}}. The right half of the figure shows a plot of \(y=f'(x)\), where \(f'(x) = 4 - 2x\), with emphasis on the \(y\)-coordinates of the derivative graph at the same selection of points. Notice the connection between colors in the left and right graphs: the green tangent line on the original graph is tied to the green point on the right graph in the following way: \emph{the slope of the tangent line} at a point on the left-hand graph is the same as the \emph{\(y\)-value} at the corresponding point on the right-hand graph. That is, at each respective value of \(x\), the slope of the tangent line to the original function is the same as the output of the derivative function. Do note, however, that the units on the vertical axes are different: in the left graph, the vertical units are simply the output units of \(f\). On the righthand graph of \(y = f'(x)\), the units on the vertical axis are units of \(f\) per unit of \(x\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-726}{}%
An excellent way to explore how the graph of \(f(x)\) generates the graph of \(f'(x)\) is through a java applet. See, for instance, the applets at \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/5C}{http://gvsu.edu/s/5C} or \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/5D}{http://gvsu.edu/s/5D},  via the sites of Austin and Renault.\footnote{David Austin, \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/5r}{http://gvsu.edu/s/5r}; Marc Renault, \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/5p}{http://gvsu.edu/s/5p}.\label{fn-5}}%
\par
\hypertarget{p-727}{}%
When we first defined the derivative in \hyperref[sec-1-3-derivative-pt]{Section~\ref{sec-1-3-derivative-pt}}, we wrote the definition in terms of a value \(a\) to find \(f'(a)\). As we have seen above, the letter \(a\) is merely a placeholder and it often makes more sense to use \(x\) instead. For the record, here we restate the definition of the derivative.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-728}{}%
\index{derivative!definition} \begin{assemblage}[Derivative Function]\label{D-derivative-defn-x}
\hypertarget{p-729}{}%
Let \(f\) be a function and \(x\) a value in the function's domain. We define a new function called \(f'\) to be the \terminology{derivative} of \(f\), where \(f'\) is given by the formula%
\begin{equation*}
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
provided this limit exists.%
\end{assemblage}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-730}{}%
We now have two different ways of thinking about the derivative function: \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*]
\item\hypertarget{li-394}{}Given a graph of \(y = f(x)\), how does this graph lead to the graph of the derivative function \(y = f'(x)\)? and%
\item\hypertarget{li-395}{}Given a formula for \(y = f(x)\), how does the limit definition of derivative generate a formula for \(y = f'(x)\)?%
\end{enumerate}
 Both of these issues are explored in the following examples.%
\begin{example}[]\label{act-1-4-1}
\hypertarget{p-731}{}%
Below you will find the graphs of eight different functions, each on a grid with scale \(1\times1\). For each given graph, sketch an approximate graph of its derivative function on the axes immediately below. Assume the \emph{horizontal} scale of the grid for each derivative graph is identical to that for the original function. If necessary, adjust the vertical scale on the axes for the graphs of each derivative. Label all axes (vertical and horizontal) with the scales you use. %
\par
\hypertarget{p-732}{}%
When you are finished with all eight graphs, write several sentences that describe your overall process for sketching the graph of the derivative function given the graph of the original function. What are the values of the derivative function that you tend to identify first? What do you do thereafter? How do key traits of the graph of the derivative function exemplify properties of the graph of the original function?%

The graphs of each given function with its derivative are shown below. In graphing each derivative, it was easiest to first identify the points of horizontal tangency on the original graph in order to plot the zeros of the derivative. From there, we identified intervals where the original function was increasing (or decreasing), and plotted positive (or negative) values for the derivative on those same intervals. We ensured that the derivative values had larger magnitude at those points where the original graph had the steepest slope. In the case where the original graph had a corner or a cusp, we placed a jump discontinuity in the derivative graph. Asymptotic behavior of the original function also was reflected in the graph of the corresponding derivative function.%

For a dynamic investigation that allows you to experiment with graphing \(f'\) when given the graph of \(f\), see \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/8y}{http://gvsu.edu/s/8y}.\footnote{Marc Renault, Calculus Applets Using Geogebra.\label{fn-6}}%

Now, recall the opening example of this section: we began with the function \(f(x) = 4x - x^2\) and used the limit definition of the derivative to show that \(f'(a) = 4 - 2a\), or equivalently that \(f'(x) = 4 - 2x\). We subsequently graphed the functions \(f\) and \(f'\) in \hyperref[F-1-4-ffprime]{Figure~\ref{F-1-4-ffprime}}. Following \hyperref[act-1-4-1]{Example~\ref{act-1-4-1}}, we now understand that we could have constructed a fairly accurate graph of \(f'(x)\) \emph{without} knowing a formula for either \(f\) or \(f'\). Even so, it is useful to know a formula for the derivative function whenever it is possible to find one.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-737}{}%
In the next example, we further explore the more algebraic approach to finding a derivative: given a formula for \(y = f(x)\), the limit definition of the derivative will be used to develop a formula for \(f'(x)\).%
\begin{example}[]\label{act-1-4-2}
\hypertarget{p-738}{}%
For each of the listed functions, determine a formula for the derivative function. For the first two, determine the formula for the derivative by thinking about the nature of the given function and its slope at various points; do not use the limit definition. For the latter four, use the limit definition. Pay careful attention to the function names and independent variables. It is important to be comfortable with using letters other than \(f\) and \(x\). For example, given a function \(p(z)\), we call its derivative \(p'(z)\). \leavevmode%

The instantaneous rate of change of a linear function at a given point is the same regardless of the point chosen. This is because linear functions have a constant slope, so any tangent line to a linear function coincides with the function itself (i.e., they are the same line).

\item{}\hypertarget{p-763}{}%
The limit definition of the derivative, \(f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\), produces a value for each \(x\) at which the derivative is defined, and this leads to a new function \(y = f'(x)\). It is especially important to note that taking the derivative is a process that starts with a given function \(f\) and produces a new, related function \(f'\).%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-764}{}%
There is essentially no difference between writing \(f'(a)\) (as we did regularly in \hyperref[sec-1-3-derivative-pt]{Section~\ref{sec-1-3-derivative-pt}}) and writing \(f'(x)\). In either case, the variable is just a placeholder that is used to define the rule for the derivative function.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-765}{}%
Given the graph of a function \(y = f(x)\), we can sketch an approximate graph of its derivative \(y = f'(x)\) by observing that \emph{\(y\)-coordinates} on the derivative's graph correspond to \emph{slopes} on the original function's graph.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-766}{}%
In \hyperref[act-1-4-1]{Example~\ref{act-1-4-1}}, we encountered some functions that had sharp corners on their graphs, such as the shifted absolute value function. At such points, the derivative fails to exist, and we say that \(f\) is not differentiable there. For now, it suffices to understand this as a consequence of the jump that must occur in the derivative function at a sharp corner on the graph of the original function.%

The fact that \(f\) is differentiable everywhere means that the graph of \(f\) is smooth everywhere. The slopes of the tangent lines to \(f\) are negative but increasing on the interval \((-\infty,0)\) and positive and increasing on the interval \((0,\infty)\), with a slope of \(0\) when \(x=0\). This is the kind of behavior that a quadratic function possesses, so we could guess that \(f\) has a graph something like that shown in the figure below.%
\item\hypertarget{li-430}{}\hypertarget{p-776}{}%
Because the change in the derivative values is constant, it looks like \(f'\) is linear with a slope of \(1\), passing through the point \((0,0)\), so it is reasonable to guess that \(f'(x) = x\). A plot of \(f'\) is shown at right in the figure below.%

A natural guess is \(f(x) = x^2\); since we need the function to pass through the point \((1,-2)\), we might try \(f(x) = x^2 - 3\). Using the limit definition, we have%
\begin{align*}
f'(x) &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\left[(x+h)^2-3\right] - \left[x^2-3\right]}{h}\\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\left[x^2+2xh+h^2-3\right] - \left[x^2-3\right]}{h}\\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{2xh+h^2}{h}\\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} 2x+h\\
&= 2x\text{.}
\end{align*}
So this guess is close, but is off by a factor of \(2\), since we want \(f'(x) = x\). Instead, if we use \(f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^2-1\) (note that we chose the ``\(-1\)'' so that \(f(-2)=1\), then we have%
\begin{align*}
f'(x) &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\left[\frac{1}{2}(x+h)^2-1\right] - \left[\frac{1}{2}x^2-1\right]}{h}\\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\frac{1}{2}\left[x^2+2xh+h^2\right] - \frac{1}{2}\left[x^2\right]}{h}\\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{1}{2}\frac{2xh+h^2}{h}\\
&= \lim_{h \to 0} x+\frac{h}{2}\\
&= x\text{.}
\end{align*}
This appears to be the correct function \(f\).%

In the above figure, we see plots of both \(g\) and \(g'\). We observe that the point \((0.5, 2.75)\) is the vertex of the quadratic function \(g\), and at this point the slope of the tangent line to \(g(x)\) is zero. This aligns with the point \((0.5, 0)\) where \(y=g'(x)\) crosses the \(x\)-axis. In addition, we note that \(g'(x)\) is negative for \(x \lt 0.5\), which corresponds to where \(g\) is decreasing and has tangent lines with slopes that are negative. Similarly, the values of \(g'\) are positive for \(x \gt 0.5\), which align with the values of slopes we see on the original function \(g\).%

For \(g(x) = x^2 - x + 3\), we found that \(g'(x) = 2x - 1\). For \(p(x) = 5x^2 - 4x + 12\), we determined that \(p'(x) = 10x - 4\). The constants \(3\) and \(12\) don't seem to affect the results at all, and that makes sense because those numbers only serve to shift the graphs of \(g\) and \(p\) vertically, which does nothing to change the slope. The coefficient \(-4\) on the linear term in \(p(x)\) appears to make the ``\(-4\)'' appear in \(p'(x)= 10x - 4\). That, too, makes sense in light of the fact that if we considered only the linear function \(L(x) = -4x\), the slope would everywhere be \(-4\), in contrast to the coefficent \(-1\) found on the linear term in \(g(x) = x^2 - x + 3\), which leads to the constant \(-1\) in \(g'(x) = 2x - 1\). Finally, the leading coefficient \(5\) in \((x) = 5x^2 - 4x + 12\) leads to the coefficient of ``\(10\)'' in \(p'(x) = 10x -4\). This makes sense because if we considered only \(y = 5x^2\), the \(5\) would make the graph \(5\) times as steep as the graph of \(y = x^2\), and thus it affects the derivative proportionately.%

Since \(g'(x)\) is constant (with value \(1\)) on the interval \(0 \lt x \lt 2\), it follows that \(g\) is linear on that same interval, since \(g\) is increasing at a constant rate.%
\item\hypertarget{li-453}{}\hypertarget{p-804}{}%
On \(-3.5 \lt x \lt -2\), we also expect \(g\) to be linear with slope \(1\), while on \(-2 \lt x \lt 0\) and \(2 \lt x \lt 3.5\), \(g\) will be linear with slope \(-1\); in each case this is true because the value of \(g'(x)\) is constant with the noted value on the interval.%

From the given graph of \(g'(x)\), we observe that \(g'\) is undefined at \(x = -2, 0, 2\). Since we have been given that \(g\) is a continuous function, we can conclude that \(g\) must have sharp corners on its graph at these points. Moreover, that makes sense in light of our earlier observations that show \(g\) has constant slope on the intervals that connect at \(x = -2, 0, 2\) and the graph jumps from having slope \(1\) to \(-1\), and then back, and so on.%

In contexts other than the position of a moving object, what does the derivative of a function measure?%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-809}{}%
What are the units of the derivative function \(f'\), and how are they related to the units of the original function \(f\)?%

Given the value of the derivative of a function at a point, what can we infer about how the value of the function changes nearby?%

A powerful feature of mathematics is that it can be studied both as an abstract discipline and as an applied one. For instance, calculus can be developed almost entirely as an abstract collection of ideas that focus on properties of functions. At the same time, if we consider functions that represent meaningful processes, calculus can describe our experience of physical reality. We have already seen that for the position function \(y = s(t)\) of a ball being tossed straight up in the air, the derivative of the position function, \(v(t) = s'(t)\), gives the ball's velocity at time \(t\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-812}{}%
In this section, we investigate several functions with specific physical meaning and consider how the units on the independent variable, dependent variable, and the derivative function add to our understanding. To start, we consider the familiar problem of a position function of a moving object.%

One of the longest stretches of straight (and flat) road in North America can be found on the Great Plains as part of North Dakota state Highway 46, which lies just south of the interstate highway I-94 and runs through the town of Gackle. Suppose a car leaves town (at time \(t = 0\)) and heads east on Highway 46; its position in miles from Gackle at time \(t\) in minutes is given by the graph of the function in \hyperref[F-1-5-PA1]{Figure~\ref{F-1-5-PA1}} below. Three important points are labeled on the graph; where the curve looks linear, you may assume that it is indeed a straight line.%

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-471}{}\hypertarget{p-827}{}%
For the first \(57\) minutes, the car travels away from Gackle at a constant speed. Since it travels a total of \(63.8\) miles during this time, its velocity is \(\frac{63.8}{57}\) miles per minute, or approximately \(67.16\) miles per hour. The car is stopped between minutes \(57\) and \(68\), and then resumes driving away from Gackle, again at a constant speed. Between \(68\) and \(104\) minutes, the car travels \(106.8-63.8=43\) miles, so its (average) velocity during this time is \(\frac{43}{104-68}=\frac{43}{36}\) miles per minute, or about \(71.67\) miles per hour.%
\item\hypertarget{li-472}{}\hypertarget{p-828}{}%
The slope of the line between the points \((57,63.8)\) and \((104,106.8)\) is \(m=\frac{106.8-63.8}{104-57}=\frac{43}{57}\approx0.754\) miles per minute. This value represents the average speed of the car between \(57\) and \(104\) minutes of driving. Because the car is stopped for the first \(11\) minutes of this time interval, the average speed on this interval is down to approximately \(45\) miles per hour.%
\item\hypertarget{li-473}{}\hypertarget{p-829}{}%
The average rate of change of the car's position on the interval \([68,104]\) is%
\begin{equation*}
AV_{[68,104]}=\frac{106.8-63.8}{104-68}=\frac{43}{36}\approx1.194
\end{equation*}
miles per minute. On this interval, the car travels at an average speed of \(72\) miles per hour.%
\item\hypertarget{li-474}{}\hypertarget{p-830}{}%
At \(t=80\) minutes, we are solidly in the middle of the time interval \([68,104]\), during which the car appears to be traveling at a constant velocity of about \(72\) miles per hour. A constant velocity (and in general, a linear position function) on an interval means the instantaneous velocity of the car at a point on that interval is the same as the average velocity of the car over that interval. Therefore, the instantaneous rate of change of the car's position at the moment \(t=80\) minutes is about \(72\) miles per hour, or \(1.2\) miles per minute.%

\subsection[{Units of the Derivative Function}]{Units of the Derivative Function}\label{sec-1-5-units-ss-1}
\hypertarget{p-831}{}%
As we now know, the derivative of the function \(f\) at a fixed value \(x\) is given by%
\begin{equation*}
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and this value has several different interpretations. If we set \(x = a\), one meaning of \(f'(a)\) is the slope of the tangent line at the point \((a,f(a))\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-832}{}%
We also sometimes write \(\frac{df}{dx}\) or \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) instead of \(f'(x)\), and these alternate notations help us see the units (and thus the meaning) of the derivative as \emph{the instantaneous rate of change of \(f\) with respect to \(x\)}. \index{instantaneous rate of change} The units on the slope of the secant line, \(\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\), are ``units of \(y\) per unit of \(x\),'' and when we take the limit as \(h\) goes to zero, the derivative \(f'(x)\) has the same units: units of \(y\) per unit of \(x\). It is helpful to remember that the units on the derivative function are ``units of output per unit of input,'' for the variables of the original function.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-58}
\hypertarget{p-833}{}%
Suppose that the function \(y = P(t)\) measures the population of a city (in thousands) at the start of year \(t\) (where \(t = 0\) corresponds to 2010 AD). We are told that \(P'(2) = 21.37\). What is the meaning of this value?%
\par
\hypertarget{p-834}{}%
Since \(P\) is measured in thousands and \(t\) is measured in years, we can say that the instantaneous rate of change of the city's population with respect to time at the start of 2012 is 21.37 thousand people per year. We therefore expect that in the coming year, about 21,370 people will be added to the city's population.%

\subsection[{Tangent Lines}]{Tangent Lines}\label{subsection-36}
\hypertarget{p-835}{}%
Recall that a line can be written as \(y=m(x-x_0)+y_0\) where \(m\) is the slope of the line and \((x_0,y_0)\) is a point on the line.  Using this information we are in a position to quickly find the equation for the tangent line to a curve at a point.  Specifically, we have the following definition.%
\par
\hypertarget{Tandef}{}%
\index{tangent line!equation} \begin{assemblage}[The Tangent Line]\label{assemblage-50}
\hypertarget{p-837}{}%
Given a differentiable function \(f\) and a point \((x_0,y_0)\) the equation for the \terminology{tangent line to the function \(f\) at \((x_0,y_0)\)} is given by%
\begin{equation*}
y=f'(x_0)(x-x_0)+y_0.
\end{equation*}
%
\end{assemblage}
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-59}
\hypertarget{p-838}{}%
We can find the equation of the line tangent to the curve given by graphing \(y=f(x)\) where \(f(x)=x^2+2\) at \((2,3)\) by first noting that%
\begin{equation*}
f'(x)=\lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{(x+h)^2+2-x^2-2}{h}=2x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Therefore the equation of the tangent line to \(f\) at \((2,3)\) is%
\begin{equation*}
y=f'(2)(x-2)+3=4(x-2)-3=4x-5\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-839}{}%
We will look more at tangent lines in future sections but the basic ideas appear here.  Specifically, if we know data about a function at a specific point such as it's value at that point and rate of change at that point then we can estimate its value at a future point.%

After \(64\) minutes in the oven, the temperature of the potato is \(330.28\) degrees Fahrenheit and is increasing at a rate of \(1.341\) degrees per minute. We expect \(F(65)\approx 331.625\) degrees, and \(F(66)\approx 332.962\) degrees.%

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-481}{}\hypertarget{p-851}{}%
The value \(F(64) = 330.28\) is the temperature of the potato in degrees Fahrenheit after \(64\) minutes in the oven, while \(F'(64) = 1.341\) measures the instantaneous rate of change of the potato's temperature with respect to time at the instant \(t = 64\) minutes, and its units are degrees per minute. Because at time \(t = 64\) the potato's temperature is increasing at a rate of \(1.341\) degrees per minute, we expect that at \(t = 65\), the temperature will be about \(1.341\) degrees greater than at \(t = 64\), or in other words \(F(65) \approx 330.28 + 1.341 = 331.621\) degrees. Similarly, at \(t = 66\), two minutes have elapsed from \(t = 64\), so we expect an increase of \(2 \cdot 1.341\) degrees: \(F(66) \approx 330.28 + 2 \cdot 1.341 = 332.962\) degrees.%
\item\hypertarget{li-482}{}\hypertarget{p-852}{}%
Throughout the time interval \([0,90]\), the temperature \(F\) of the potato is increasing. But as time goes on, the rate at which the temperature is rising should decrease. That is, while the values of \(F\) continue to get larger as time progresses, the values of \(F'\) are getting smaller (while still remaining positive). We thus might say that ``the temperature of the potato is increasing, but at a decreasing rate.''%

\(C(2000) = 800\) means that it costs \textdollar{}800 to make 2000 feet of rope.%

The units of \(C'(r)\) are ``dollars per foot.''%
\item\hypertarget{li-500}{}\hypertarget{p-874}{}%
If \(C(2000) = 800\) and \(C'(2000) = 0.35\), then we know that once 2000 feet of rope are produced, the total cost function is increasing at \textdollar{}0.35 per additional foot of rope. So, if we manufacture an additional 100 feet of rope, the additional total cost will be approximately%
\begin{equation*}
100 \ \text{feet}  \cdot 0.35 \ \frac{\text{dollars} }{\text{foot} } = 35 \ \text{dollars}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Therefore, we find that \(C(2100) \approx C(2000) + 35 = 835\), or that the cost to make 2100 feet of rope is about \textdollar{}835.%
\item\hypertarget{li-501}{}\hypertarget{p-875}{}%
Either \(C'(2000) = C'(3000)\) or \(C'(2000) > C'(3000)\), since we expect the cost per foot of additional rope to either stay constant or to get smaller as the production volume increases. Said differently, the instantaneous rate of change of the total cost function should either be constant or decrease due to economy of scale.%
\item\hypertarget{li-502}{}\hypertarget{p-876}{}%
It is impossible to have \(C'(5000) = -0.1\) and indeed to have any negative derivative value for the total cost function. The total cost function \(C(r)\) can never decrease, because it doesn't make sense for the total cost of producing 5001 feet of rope to be less than the total cost of producing 5000 feet of rope.%

In \hyperref[sec-1-4-derivative-fxn]{Section~\ref{sec-1-4-derivative-fxn}}, we learned how use to the graph of a given function \(f\) to plot the graph of its derivative, \(f'\). It is important to remember that when we do so, the scale and the units on the vertical axis often have to change to represent \(f'\). For example, suppose that \(P(t) = 400-330e^{-0.03t}\) tells us the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit of a potato in an oven at time \(t\) in minutes. In \hyperref[F-1-5-PPprime]{Figure~\ref{F-1-5-PPprime}} below, we sketch the graph of \(P\) on the left and the graph of \(P'\) on the right.%

Notice that both the size and the units of the vertical scales differ, as the units of \(P\) are \(^{\circ}\)F, while those of \(P'\) are \(^{\circ}\)F/min.%

Using the average rate of change formula, we find that the slope of the secant line connecting \((9.99,F(9.99))\) and \((10.01,F(10.01))\) is%
\begin{equation*}
F'(10) \approx \frac{F(10.01) - F(9.99)}{0.02} = \frac{(75 + 110 e^{-0.05\cdot 10.01}) - (75 + 110 e^{-0.05\cdot 9.99})}{0.02} \approx -3.33592\text{.}

\item\hypertarget{li-526}{}\hypertarget{p-910}{}%
Since \(F\) is measured in degrees Fahrenheit and \(t\) in minutes, we have \(F'(10) \approx -3.33592\) degrees F per minute. This means that at the instant \(t=10\), the temperature of the coffee is decreasing at an instantaneous rate of about \(3.33592\) degrees per minute. Said differently, in the next minute, we'd expect the temperature of the coffee to drop about \(3.33592\) degrees.%
\item\hypertarget{li-527}{}\hypertarget{p-911}{}%
We expect the coffee's temperature to decrease quickly early on when the difference between its temperature and the surroundings is greatest, and as time goes on for the coffee's temperature to approach that of the surrounding room. Keeping in mind that \(F\) is an always decreasing function so that \(F'\) is always negative, we observe that \(F'(10)\) should be less (more negative) than \(F'(20)\). These observations can also be confirmed by plotting a graph of \(F\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-528}{}\hypertarget{p-912}{}%
We have noted that \(F'\) is always negative, and that we expect \(F'\) to get closer and closer to \(0\) as time goes on (that is, \(F'\) is increasing). As such, we expect \(F'\) to look something like the graph of \(y = -e^{-x}\). This is reasonable since \(-e^{-x}\) is also an exponential function, is always negative, is always increasing, and approaches \(0\) as \(x\) increases.%

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-546}{}\hypertarget{p-936}{}%
Observe that \(v(t) = 16-32t\) is a linear function with negative slope \(-32\), and thus decreasing. Since the function is of interest from \(t = 0\) to \(t=2\), the velocity is greatest at the left endpoint, when \(t=0\). This greatest velocity is \(v(0) = 16\) feet per second.%
\item\hypertarget{li-547}{}\hypertarget{p-937}{}%
Since \(v\) is a linear function, its slope is constant, and hence the slope of every tangent line to the function is the same as the slope of the line the function generates. Thus, \(v'(1) = -32\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-548}{}\hypertarget{p-938}{}%
Because \(v\) is measured in feet per second and \(t\) in seconds, the units on \(v'(1)\) are ``feet per second per second.'' Knowing that \(v'(1) = -32\), this tells us that the ball's velocity is decreasing at a rate of 32 feet per second per second; that is, for whatever the ball's velocity is at \(t = 1\), we would expect the velocity to decrease by (exactly) \(32\) feet per second over the next one second. (Normally this total decrease would be approximate, not exact, but since the velocity function is linear, we can compute the exact total change.)%
\item\hypertarget{li-549}{}\hypertarget{p-939}{}%
The instantaneous rate of change of velocity is precisely the acceleration of the ball. Indeed, \(v'(t)\) tells us how the ball's velocity changes, and that it does so at a constant rate of \(-32\) feet per second per second. This is also consistent with the fact that acceleration due to gravity is constant.%

To find the average rate of change of \(h\) on the interval \([40000,55000]\), we divide the change in \(h\) values (in dollars) on this interval by the change in \(m\) values (in miles) to obtain%
\begin{equation*}
AV_{[40000,55000]} = \frac{h(55000)- h(40000)}{55000-40000} = \frac{13200-15500}{15000} = -\frac{2300}{15000} \approx -0.153

Since \(40 000\) and \(70 0000\) are equidistant from \(55 000\), we can estimate the derivative of \(h\) at \(55 0000\) to obtain%
\begin{equation*}
h'(55000) \approx \frac{h(70000) - h(40000)}{70000-40000} = \frac{11100-15500}{30000} = - \frac{4400}{30000} \approx -0.147
\end{equation*}
dollars per mile. This approximation tells us that at the instant the car has been driven \(55 000\) miles, the car's value is decreasing at an instantaneous rate of \(0.147\) dollars per mile. That is, during \(55 0001\)st mile, we'd expect the car's value to drop by \(0.147\) dollars.%
\item\hypertarget{li-560}{}\hypertarget{p-953}{}%
As we pile up miles on our car, we expect the value to go down. However, we should expect the depreciation to be more extreme at first, but less in magnitude as we drive more miles and our car gets older. Note, though, the the value of the car is always decreasing and \(h'(m)\) is always negative. Thus, we should expect that the rate of change of \(h\) is increasing (becoming less negative) as \(m\) increases and that \(h'(30000) \lt h'(80000)\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-561}{}\hypertarget{p-954}{}%
The value of a car is never negative. So we know that \(h(m) \geq 0\) for all \(m\). A new car decreases in value very quickly at first, and as the car gets older with more mileage, its value will depreciate to near zero. So \(h\) is a decreasing function. Since the value of our car always decreases, it follows that \(h'(m) \lt 0\) for all \(m \gt 0\). The fact that the depreciation slows as \(m\) increases implies that \(h'\) is an increasing (getting less negative) function. Since \(h'\) is increasing, it follows that \(h\) is bends upward; we will study this issue more in Section 1.6. So the graph of \(h\) might have the general shape of the graph of \(y = e^{-x}\) for positive values of \(x\).%

How does the derivative of a function tell us whether the function is increasing or decreasing at a point or on an interval?%

\hypertarget{p-959}{}%
Given a differentiable function \(y= f(x)\), we know that its derivative, \(y = f'(x)\), is a related function whose output at \(x=a\) tells us the slope of the tangent line to \(y = f(x)\) at the point \((a,f(a))\). That is, \(y\)-coordinates on the derivative graph tell us the values of slopes on the original function's graph.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-960}{}%
At a point where \(f'(x)\) is positive, the slope of the tangent line to \(f\) is positive. Therefore, on an interval where \(f'(x)\) is positive, the function \(f\) is increasing (or rising). \index{increasing} Similarly, if \(f'(x)\) is negative on an interval, the graph of \(f\) is decreasing \index{decreasing} (or falling).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-961}{}%
The derivative of \(f\) tells us not only \emph{whether} the function \(f\) is increasing or decreasing on an interval, but also \emph{how} the function \(f\) is increasing or decreasing. Look at the two tangent lines shown below in \hyperref[F-1-6-Intro]{Figure~\ref{F-1-6-Intro}}. We see that at point \(A\) the value of \(f'(x)\) is positive and relatively close to zero, and at that point the graph is rising slowly. By contrast, at point \(B\), the derivative is negative and relatively large in absolute value, and \(f\) is decreasing rapidly at \(B\).%

Besides asking whether the value of the derivative function is positive or negative and whether it is large or small, we can also ask ``how is the derivative changing?''%

Because the derivative, \(y = f'(x)\), is itself a function, we can consider taking its derivative \textemdash{} the derivative of the derivative \textemdash{} and ask ``what does the derivative of the derivative tell us about how the original function behaves?''

At time \(t=0\), the car is at rest but gradually accelerates to a speed of about \(6000\) ft/min as it drives about \(1300\) feet during the first minute of travel. The car reaches its peak speed of about \(7000\) ft/min just after the time \(t=1\) minute (and again just after the points \(t=4\), \(t=7\), and \(t=10\) minutes). In the second minute, the car gradually slows back down, coming to a stop about \(4000\) feet from where it started. It waits there for a minute (between \(t=2\) minutes and \(t=3\) minutes) before continuing to drive in the same direction as before. At this point, the car again gradually accelerates to a speed of about \(6000\) ft/min by the end of the fourth minute, at which point it has driven around \(5300\) feet since starting out. During the fifth minute, the car gradually slows back to a stop after traveling an additional \(2700\) feet. This pattern of starts and stops continues for a total of \(12\) minutes, by which time the car has traveled a total of \(16,000\) feet from its starting point.%

So far, we have used the words \emph{increasing} and \emph{decreasing} intuitively to describe a function's graph. Here we define these terms more formally.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-990}{}%
\begin{assemblage}[Increasing and Decreasing Functions]\label{assemblage-51}
\hypertarget{p-991}{}%
Given a function \(f(x)\) defined on the interval \((a,b)\), we say that \terminology{\(f\) is increasing on \((a,b)\)} \index{increasing} provided that \(f(x)\lt f(y)\) whenever \(a\lt x\lt y\lt b\).  Similarly, we say that \terminology{\(f\) is decreasing on \((a,b)\)} \index{decreasing} provided that \(f(x)\gt f(y)\) whenever \(a\lt x\lt y\lt b\). %
\end{assemblage}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-992}{}%
Simply put, an increasing function is one that is rising as we move from left to right along the graph, and a decreasing function is one that falls as the value of the input increases. If the function has a derivative, the sign of the derivative tells us whether the function is increasing or decreasing.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-993}{}%
Let \(f\) be a function that is differentiable on an interval \((a,b)\). If the function \(f\) is increasing on \((a,b)\) then \(f'(x) \geq 0\) for every \(x\) in the interval \((a, b)\). Conversely, if \(f'(x) > 0\) for every \(x\) in the interval, then the function \(f\) must be increasing on the interval. Notice that we have to have the derivative strictly positive to conclude that the function is increasing. Letting \(f\) be a constant function shows that if the derivative can be zero, then the function need not be increasing.  Also, knowing the function is increasing is not enough to conclude that the derivative is positive.  The function \(f(x)=x^3\) is increasing on \((-1,1)\) but \(f'(0)=0\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-994}{}%
Similarly, if the function \(f\) is decreasing on \((a,b)\) then \(f'(x) \leq 0\) for every \(x\) in the interval \((a, b)\). Conversely, if \(f'(x) \lt 0\) for every \(x\) in the interval, then the function \(f\) must be decreasing on the interval.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-995}{}%
For example, the function pictured below in \hyperref[F-1-6-Intro2]{Figure~\ref{F-1-6-Intro2}} is increasing on the entire interval \(-2 \lt x \lt 0\). Note that at both \(x = \pm 2\) and \(x = 0\), we say that \(f\) is neither increasing nor decreasing, because \(f'(x) = 0\) at these values.%

\index{second derivative}\index{derivative!second derivative}\hypertarget{p-996}{}%
We are now accustomed to investigating the behavior of a function by examining its derivative. The derivative of a function \(f\) is a new function given by the rule%
\begin{equation*}
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-997}{}%
Because \(f'\) is itself a function, it is perfectly feasible for us to consider the derivative of the derivative, which is the new function \(y = [f'(x)]'\). We call this resulting function \emph{the second derivative of \(f\),}   and denote the second derivative by \(y = f''(x)\). Consequently, we will sometimes call \(f'\) ``the first derivative'' of \(f\), rather than simply ``the derivative'' of \(f\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-998}{}%
\index{second derivative!definition} \begin{assemblage}[Second Derivative]\label{assemblage-52}
\hypertarget{p-999}{}%
The \terminology{second derivative} is defined by applying the limit definition of the derivative to the first derivative. That is,%
\begin{equation*}
f''(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f'(x+h)-f'(x)}{h}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
We read ``\(f''(x)\)'' as ``\(f\)-double prime of \(x\)'', or as ``the second derivative of \(f\)''.%
\end{assemblage}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1000}{}%
The meaning of the derivative function still holds, so when we compute \(f''(x)\), this new function measures slopes of tangent lines to the curve \(y = f'(x)\), as well as the instantaneous rate of change of \(y = f'(x)\). In other words, just as the first derivative measures the rate at which the original function changes, the \emph{second} derivative measures the rate at which the \emph{first} derivative changes. The second derivative will help us understand how the rate of change of the original function is itself changing.%

\hypertarget{p-1001}{}%
In addition to asking \emph{whether} a function is increasing or decreasing, it is also natural to inquire \emph{how} a function is increasing or decreasing. There are three basic behaviors that an increasing function can demonstrate on an interval, as pictured below in \hyperref[F-1-6-3optsi]{Figure~\ref{F-1-6-3optsi}}: the function can increase more and more rapidly, it can increase at the same rate, or it can increase in a way that is slowing down. Fundamentally, we are beginning to think about how a particular curve bends, with the natural comparison being made to lines, which don't bend at all. More than this, we want to understand how the bend in a function's graph is tied to behavior characterized by the first derivative of the function.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/1_6_3optsi.pdf}
\caption{Three functions that are all increasing, but doing so at an increasing rate, at a constant rate, and at a decreasing rate, respectively.\label{F-1-6-3optsi}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-1002}{}%
On the leftmost curve in \hyperref[F-1-6-3optsi]{Figure~\ref{F-1-6-3optsi}}, draw a sequence of tangent lines to the curve. As we move from left to right, the slopes of those tangent lines will increase. Therefore, the rate of change of the pictured function is increasing, and this explains why we say this function is \emph{increasing at an increasing rate}. For the rightmost graph in \hyperref[F-1-6-3optsi]{Figure~\ref{F-1-6-3optsi}}, observe that as \(x\) increases, the function increases, but the slopes of the tangent lines decrease. This function is \emph{increasing at a decreasing rate}.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1003}{}%
Similar options hold for how a function can decrease. Here we must be extra careful with our language, because decreasing functions involve negative slopes.\footnote{Negative numbers present an interesting tension between common language and mathematical language. For example, it can be tempting to say that ``\(-100\) is bigger than \(-2\).'' But we must remember that ``greater than'' describes how numbers lie on a number line: \(x \gt y\) provided that \(x\) lies to the right of \(y\). So of course, \(-100\) is less than \(-2\). Informally, it might be helpful to say that ``\(-100\) is more negative than \(-2\).''\label{fn-7}} When a function's values are negative, and those values get more negative as the input increases, the function must be decreasing.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/1_6_3optsd.pdf}
\caption{From left to right, three functions that are all decreasing, but doing so in different ways.\label{F-1-6-3optsd}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-1004}{}%
Now consider the three graphs shown above in \hyperref[F-1-6-3optsd]{Figure~\ref{F-1-6-3optsd}}. The middle graph clearly depicts a function decreasing at a constant rate. Now draw a sequence of tangent lines on the first curve. We see that the slopes of these lines get closer to zero \textemdash{} meaning they get less and less negative \textemdash{} as we move from left to right. That means that the values of the first derivative, while all negative, are increasing, and thus we say that the leftmost curve is \emph{decreasing at an increasing rate}.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1005}{}%
This leaves only the rightmost curve in \hyperref[F-1-6-3optsd]{Figure~\ref{F-1-6-3optsd}} to consider. For that function, the slopes of the tangent lines are negative throughout the pictured interval, but as we move from left to right, the slopes get more and more negative as they get steeper. Hence the slope of the curve is decreasing, and we say that the function is \emph{decreasing at a decreasing rate}.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1006}{}%
We now introduce the notion of \emph{concavity}, \index{concavity} which provides simpler language to describe these behaviors. When a curve opens upward on a given interval, like the parabola \(y = x^2\) or the exponential growth function \(y = e^x\), we say that the curve is \emph{concave up} on that interval. Likewise, when a curve opens down, like the parabola \(y = -x^2\) or the negative exponential function \(y = -e^{x}\), we say that the function is \emph{concave down}. Concavity is linked to both the first and second derivatives of the function.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1007}{}%
In \hyperref[F-1-6-concavity]{Figure~\ref{F-1-6-concavity}} below, we see two functions and a sequence of tangent lines to each. The lefthand plot shows a function that is concave up; observe that here the tangent lines always lie below the curve itself, and the slopes of the tangent lines are increasing as we move from left to right. In other words, the graph of \(y=f(x)\) is concave up on the interval shown because its derivative, \(f'\), is increasing on that interval. Similarly, the righthand plot in \hyperref[F-1-6-concavity]{Figure~\ref{F-1-6-concavity}} depicts a function that is concave down; in this case, we see that the tangent lines alway lie above the curve and that the slopes of the tangent lines are decreasing as we move from left to right. The fact that its derivative, \(f'\), is decreasing makes \(f\) concave down on the interval shown.%

The position function \(y = s(t)\) is increasing on the intervals \(0\lt t\lt 2\), \(3\lt t\lt 5\), \(6\lt t\lt 8\), and \(9\lt t\lt 11\) because \(s'(t)\) is positive at every point in such intervals. Furthermore, \(s(t)\) is never decreasing because its derivative is never negative.%

The velocity function \(y = v(t)\) appears to be increasing on the intervals \(0\lt t\lt 1.1\), \(3\lt t\lt 4.1\), \(6\lt t\lt 7.1\), and \(9\lt t\lt 10.1\). This is because the curve \(y = s(t)\) is concave up on these intervals, which corresponds to an increasing first derivative \(y =s'(t)\). Similarly, \(y = v(t)\) appears to be decreasing on the intervals \(1.1\lt t\lt 2\), \(4.1\lt t\lt 5\), \(7.1\lt t\lt 8\), and \(10.1\lt t\lt 11\). This is due to the curve \(y = s(t)\) being concave down on these intervals, corresponding to a decreasing first derivative \(y =s'(t)\). On the intervals \(2\lt t\lt 3\), \(5\lt t\lt 6\), \(8\lt t\lt 9\), and \(11\lt t\lt 12\), the curve \(y = s(t)\) is constant, and thus linear, so \(s\) is neither concave up nor concave down.

Exploring the context of position, velocity, and acceleration is an excellent way to understand how a function, its first derivative, and its second derivative are related to one another. In \hyperref[act-1-6-1]{Example~\ref{act-1-6-1}} that we just finished, we can replace \(s\), \(v\), and \(a\) with an arbitrary function \(f\) and its derivatives \(f'\) and \(f''\), and essentially all the same observations hold. In particular, note that the following are equivalent: on an interval where the graph of \(y=f(x)\) is concave up, \(f'\) is increasing and \(f''\) is positive. Likewise, on an interval where the graph of \(y=f(x)\) is concave down, \(f'\) is decreasing and \(f''\) is negative.%

The values \(F(30)=251\), \(F'(30)=3.85\), and \(F''(30) \approx -0.119\) (which is measured in degrees per minute per minute), tell us that at the moment \(t = 30\) minutes: the temperature of the potato is \(251\) degrees, its temperature is rising at a rate of \(3.85\) degrees per minute, and the rate at which the temperature is rising is \emph{falling} at a rate of \(0.119\) degrees per minute per minute.

Recall that if the function \(s(t)\) gave the position of an object at time \(t\) then \(s'(t)\) gave the change in position, otherwise known as velocity. That is, \(s'(t)=v(t)\), where \(v(t)\) is the velocity function. Using the alternate notation introduced in \hyperref[sec-1-5-units]{Section~\ref{sec-1-5-units}} we have \(\frac{ds}{dt}=v(t)\).%

Using the alternative notation from \hyperref[sec-1-5-units-ss-1]{the previous section~\ref{sec-1-5-units-ss-1}}, we write \(\frac{d^2s}{dt^2}=a(t)\).\footnote{Notice that in higher order derivatives the exponent occurs in what appear to be different locations in the numerator and denominator.

A differentiable function \(f\) is increasing at a point or on an interval whenever its first derivative is positive, and decreasing whenever its first derivative is negative.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-1100}{}%
By taking the derivative of the derivative of a function \(f\), we arrive at the second derivative, \(f''\). The second derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of the first derivative. The sign of the second derivative tells us whether the slope of the tangent line to \(f\) is increasing or decreasing.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-1101}{}%
A differentiable function is concave up whenever its first derivative is increasing (equivalently, whenever its second derivative is positive), and concave down whenever its first derivative is decreasing (equivalently, whenever its second derivative is negative). Examples of functions that are everywhere concave up are \(y = x^2\) and \(y = e^x\); examples of functions that are everywhere concave down are \(y = -x^2\) and \(y = -e^x\).%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-1102}{}%
The units on the second derivative are ``units of output per unit of input per unit of input.'' They tell us how the value of the derivative function is changing in response to changes in the input. In other words, the second derivative tells us the rate of change of the rate of change of the original function.%

\item\hypertarget{li-693}{}\hypertarget{p-1129}{}%
From the given graph of \(g'\), we may estimate that \(g'(2) \approx 1.4\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-694}{}\hypertarget{p-1130}{}%
Observe that \(g'\) is always positive. This tells us that \(g\) must be always increasing. Therefore, it follows that \(g\) may cross the \(x\)-axis at most one time, and hence there can be at most one solution to \(g(x) = 0\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-695}{}\hypertarget{p-1131}{}%
On \(-3 \lt x \lt 3\), \(g\) changes concavity \(g\) times, since \(g'\) changes from increasing to decreasing or from decreasing to increasing \(9\) times. Whenever \(g'\) is increasing, \(g''\) is positive, and whenever \(g'\) is decreasing, \(g''\) is negative. Hence, whenever \(g'\) changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa, it follows that \(g''\) changes sign, and this causes a change in the concavity of \(g\). We therefore see that while \(g\) is always increasing, \(g\) changes concavity many times.%
\item\hypertarget{li-696}{}\hypertarget{p-1132}{}%
From the given graph of \(g'\), we can see that \(g'(1.9) \approx 0.9\) and \(g'(2.1) \approx 2\). Using a central difference, it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
g''(2) \approx \frac{g'(2.1) - g(1.9)}{0.2} \approx \frac{2-0.9}{0.2} = 5.5\text{.}

We will use central differences to estimate the requested derivatives. Thus,%
\begin{align*}
h'(4.5) &\approx \frac{h(5)-h(4)}{5-4} = \frac{69.8 - 55.5}{1} = 14.3\\
h'(5) &\approx \frac{h(5.5)-h(4.5)}{5.5-4.4} = \frac{81.6 - 60.4}{1} = 21.2\\
h'(5.5) &\approx \frac{h(6)-h(5)}{6-5} = \frac{93.7 - 69.8}{1} = 23.9

The bungee jumper is rising most rapidly at \(t = 5.5\), at a rate of about \(23.9\) feet per second.%
\item\hypertarget{li-706}{}\hypertarget{p-1147}{}%
We again use a central difference, this time to estimate \(h''(5)\). Observe that%
\begin{equation*}
h''(5) \approx \frac{h'(5.5) - h'(4.5)}{5.5-4.5} = \frac{23.9 - 14.3}{1} = 9.6

\item\hypertarget{li-707}{}\hypertarget{p-1148}{}%
\(h''(5)\) measures the acceleration of the bungee jumper at \(t = 5\). Thus we know that the person's acceleration at \(t = 5\) is about \(9.6\) feet per second per second. This measures the instantaneous rate of change of the jumper's velocity.%
\item\hypertarget{li-708}{}\hypertarget{p-1149}{}%
The bungee jumper's position function is concave down on approximately the intervals \(0 \lt t \lt 2\), \(6 \lt t \lt 10\). This is easiest to see if we plot the data using a program like Excel. On these time intervals, the velocity of the jumper is decreasing: either the velocity is positive and getting less positive, or negative and getting more negative.%

When a function is decreasing, its graph falls as \(x\) increases, and when a function is concave down, that means the graph of the function looks like an upside down bowl. A graph of a decreasing, concave down function \(p\) on the interval \((-3,0)\) is shown in the figure below. When a function is increasing, its graph rises as \(x\) increases. The function \(p\) in the figure is increasing and concave down on the interval \((0,3)\).%

\subsection[{Being Differentiable at a Point}]{Being Differentiable at a Point}\label{subsection-44}
\index{differentiable}\hypertarget{p-1164}{}%
We recall that a function \(f\) is said to be differentiable at \(x = a\) if \(f'(a)\) exists. Moreover, for \(f'(a)\) to exist, we know that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) must have a tangent line at the point \((a,f(a))\), since the value of \(f'(a)\) is precisely the slope of this line. Observe that in order to ask if \(f\) has a tangent line at \((a,f(a))\), it is necessary for \(f\) to be continuous at \(x = a\): if \(f\) fails to have a limit at \(x = a\), if \(f(a)\) is not defined, or if \(f(a)\) does not equal the value of \(\lim_{x \to a} f(x)\), then it doesn't make sense to talk about a tangent line to the curve at this point.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1165}{}%
Indeed, it can be proved formally that if a function \(f\) is differentiable at \(x = a\), then it must be continuous at \(x = a\). Stated differently, if \(f\) is not continuous at \(x = a\), then it is automatically the case that \(f\) is not differentiable there. For example, in \hyperref[F-1-7-ContDiff]{Figure~\ref{F-1-7-ContDiff}} below, both \(f\) and \(g\) fail to be differentiable at \(x = 1\) because neither function is continuous at \(x = 1\).%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/1_7_Cont.pdf}
\caption{Functions \(f\) and \(g\) that are not continuous (and hence not differentiable) at \(x=1\), and a function \(h\) that is both continuous and differentiable at \(x=1\).\label{F-1-7-ContDiff}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-1166}{}%
A natural question to ask at this point is ``is there a difference between continuity and differentiability?'' In other words, can a function fail to be differentiable at a point where the function is continuous? To answer these questions, we consider a certain function \(f\), where the graph of \(y=f(x)\) is displayed below in \hyperref[F-1-7-NotDiff]{Figure~\ref{F-1-7-NotDiff}}. We notice that \(f\) has a sharp corner at the point \((1,1)\), and further observe that \(f\) is continuous at \(x=1\) since \(\lim_{x\to1} f(x)=1=f(1)\).%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/1_7_NotDiff.pdf}
\caption{A function \(f\) that is continuous at \(x = 1\) but not differentiable at \(x = 1\); at right, we zoom in on the point \((1,1)\) in a magnified version of the box shown in the left-hand plot.\label{F-1-7-NotDiff}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-1167}{}%
However, the function \(f\) in \hyperref[F-1-7-NotDiff]{Figure~\ref{F-1-7-NotDiff}} is not differentiable at \(x = 1\) because \(f'(1)\) fails to exist. One way to see this is to observe that \(f'(x) = -1\) for every value of \(x\) that is less than 1, while \(f'(x) = +1\) for every value of \(x\) that is greater than 1. That makes it seem that either \(+1\) or \(-1\) would be equally good candidates for the value of the derivative at \(x = 1\). Alternatively, we could use the limit definition of the derivative to attempt to compute \(f'(1)\), and discover that the derivative does not exist. Finally, we can see visually in \hyperref[F-1-7-NotDiff]{Figure~\ref{F-1-7-NotDiff}} that this function does not have a tangent line at \(x=1\). Regardless of how closely we examine the function by zooming in on \((1,1)\) on the graph of \(y=f(x)\), it will always look like a ``V'' and never like a single line, which tells us there is no possibility for a tangent line there.%

\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[{Local Linearity}]{Local Linearity}\label{subsection-45}
\hypertarget{p-1168}{}%
If a function \emph{does} have a tangent line at a given point, then the function and the tangent line should appear essentially indistinguishable when we zoom in on the point of tangency.\footnote{For instance, see \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/6J}{http://gvsu.edu/s/6J} for an applet (due to David Austin, GVSU) where zooming in shows the increasing similarity between the tangent line and the curve.\label{fn-9}} Conversely, if we zoom in on a point and the function looks like a single straight line, then the function should have a tangent line there and thus be differentiable at that point.  Therefore, we say that a function that is differentiable at \(x = a\) is \terminology{locally linear}. \index{locally linear} An example of this can be seen in \hyperref[F-1-8-local-linearity]{Figure~\ref{F-1-8-local-linearity}} below, with the graph of a function \(y=f(x)\) on the left and a magnified version with the tangent line to \(f\) at \(a\) on the right.%

We know that \(g(x) = |x|\) is given by the formula \(g(x) = -x\) when \(x \lt 0\) and by \(g(x) = x\) when \(x \ge 0\). Each of these pieces of \(g\) is a straight line, so at every point other than the point where they meet, the function \(g\) has a well-defined slope and thus is differentiable whenever \(x\neq0\). The graph of \(y=g(x)\) is a translate of the earlier graph of \(y=f(x)\) from \hyperref[F-1-7-NotDiff]{Figure~\ref{F-1-7-NotDiff}}.%

%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1182}{}%
To evaluate this limit, note that \(|h| = h\) whenever \(h > 0\), and thus%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{|h|}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^+} \frac{h}{h} = 1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
In contrast, we have \(|h| = -h\) whenever \(h \lt  0\), and thus%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{|h|}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0^-} \frac{-h}{h} = -1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Since the right- and left-hand limits are not equal, it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
g'(0) =  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{|h|}{h}
\end{equation*}
does not exist. Therefore, the function \(g(x)=|x|\) is not differentiable at \(x=0\).%

\hypertarget{p-1183}{}%
Another example of when a function can fail to be differentiable at a point \(x=a\) is if the function has a vertical tangent at the point. In other words, when \(f\) is continuous at \(x=a\) and \(\lim_{x\to a}|f'(x)|=\infty\). This means the tangent lines become very steep as we move closer to \(x=a\).%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-69}
\hypertarget{p-1184}{}%
In this example, let \(f(x)=\sqrt{x}\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1185}{}%
In \hyperref[F-1-8-vertical-tangent]{Figure~\ref{F-1-8-vertical-tangent}} below, we have the graph of \(y=f(x)\) along with a progression of tangent lines at points approaching \((0,0)\) on the graph. As we approach \(x=0\), we see that the tangent lines drawn become steeper and steeper, ultimately leading to a vertical tangent line at \(x=0\).%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/1-8-vertical-tangent.gif}
\caption{As we move closer to \(x=0\), the tangent lines to the graph of \(y=f(x)\) become steeper and steeper. Notice that the tangent line closest to \(x=0\) is nearly vertical.\label{F-1-8-vertical-tangent}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-1186}{}%
We can also show this by calculating the limit of the derivative close to \(x=0\):%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x\to 0}f'(x)=\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}=\infty.
\end{equation*}
Therefore, \(f(x)\) is not differentiable at \(x=0 \).%

A function can be continuous at a point without being differentiable there. In particular, a function \(f\) is not differentiable at \(x = a\) if the graph has a sharp corner (or \emph{cusp}) \index{cusp} at the point \((a,f(a))\).%

Differentiability is a stronger condition than continuity, which is a stronger condition than having a limit. In particular, if \(f\) is differentiable at \(x = a\), then \(f\) is also continuous at \(x = a\), and if \(f\) is continuous at \(x = a\), then \(f\) has a limit at \(x = a\).%

The only value of \(a\) at which \(\lim_{x \to a} p(x)\) does not exist is \(a = 0\). This is because \(\lim_{x \to 0^-} p(x) = 0 \ne -2 = \lim_{x \to 0^+} p(x)\).%

\(p\) is not continuous at \(a = 0\) because \(\lim_{x \to 0} p(x)\) does not exist. In addition, \(p\) is not continuous at \(a=3\) because \(p(3)\) is not defined.%
\item\hypertarget{li-758}{}\hypertarget{p-1229}{}%
\(p\) is not differentiable at \(a = 0\) and at \(a = 3\) since \(p\) is not continuous at these points. In addition, \(p\) is not differentiable at \(a = -2, 1, 2\) since \(p\) has corner points at these values, making \(p\) not have a tangent line at these values.%
\item\hypertarget{li-759}{}\hypertarget{p-1230}{}%
Note that \(p\) is piecewise linear, so the value of the derivative of \(p\) (where it exists) is the slope of \(p\), which will be constant on each interval where \(p\) is linear. In addition, note that \(p'\) is not defined at \(a = -2, 0, 1, 2, 3\), which is reflected by open circles in the following plot.%

\end{objectives}
\hypertarget{p-1268}{}%
In \hyperref[C-1]{Chapter~\ref{C-1}} we developed the concept of the derivative of a function. We now know that the derivative \(f'\) of a function \(f\) measures the instantaneous rate of change of \(f\) with respect to \(x\). The derivative also tells us the slope of the tangent line to the graph of \(y=f(x)\) at any given value of \(x\). So far, we have focused on interpreting the derivative graphically or, in the context of a physical setting, as a meaningful rate of change. To calculate the value of the derivative at a specific point, we have relied on the limit definition of the derivative:%
\begin{equation*}
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1269}{}%
In this chapter we investigate how the limit definition of the derivative leads to interesting patterns and rules that enable us to quickly find a formula for \(f'(x)\) \emph{without} directly using the limit definition. For example, we would like to apply shortcuts to differentiate a function such as \(g(x) = 4x^7 - \sin(x) + 3e^x\).%

In the previous parts, we discovered that the derivatives of \(x^2\), \(x^3\), and \(x^4\) are \(2x\), \(3x^2\), and \(4x^3\), respectively. It looks like when we increase the power of \(x\) by one, this affects the derivative by increasing both the coefficient and the power of \(x\) by one. For instance, going from \(F(x)=x^2\) to \(g(x)=x^3\), we saw the derivatives go from \(F'(x)=2x\) to \(g'(x)=3x^2\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1280}{}%
Since the derivative of \(x^4\) is \(4x^3\), if this pattern continues, then it makes sense for the derivative of \(x^5\) to be \(5x^4\). Then if \(p(x)=x^{13}\), we've increased the power of \(x\) by eight from \(x^5\), so we want to increase the coefficient and power in the derivative by eight as well, to get \(p'(x)=(5+8)x^{4+8}=13x^{12}\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-809}{}The pattern we've seen is that increasing the power of \(x\) by one makes the coefficient and power of \(x\) in the derivative by one. Also, the power of \(x\) in the derivative is one less than in the original function in each case we've looked at, and the coefficient on the derivative is the same as the power in the original function. For instance, \(m(x)=x^5\) implies \(m'(x)=5x^4=5x^{5-1}\). If we try to generalize this by replacing ``\(5\)'' with ``\(n\)'', we conjecture that when \(n\) is a positive integer and \(f(x)=x^n\), then \(f'(x)=nx^{n-1}\).%

\hypertarget{p-1281}{}%
In addition to our usual \(f'\) notation, there are other ways to denote the derivative of a function, as well as the instruction to take the derivative. If we are thinking about the relationship between \(y\) and \(x\), we sometimes denote the derivative of \(y\) with respect to \(x\) by the symbol%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dx}
\end{equation*}
which we read "``dee-\(y\) dee-\(x\).''" For example, if \(y = x^2\), we'll write that the derivative is \(\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x\). This notation comes from the fact that the derivative is related to the slope of a line, and slope is measured by \(\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\). Note that while we read \(\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\) as ``change in \(y\) over change in \(x\),'' we view \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) as a single symbol, not a quotient of two quantities.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1282}{}%
We use a variant of this notation as the instruction to take the derivative. In particular,%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx}\left[ \Box \right]
\end{equation*}
means ``take the derivative of the quantity in \(\Box\) with respect to \(x\).'' For example, we may write \(\frac{d}{dx}[x^2] = 2x\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1283}{}%
It is important to note that the independent variable can be different from \(x\). If we have \(f(z) = z^2\), we then write \(f'(z) = 2z\). Similarly, if \(y = t^2\), we say \(\frac{dy}{dt} = 2t\). And it is also true that \(\frac{d}{dq}[q^2] = 2q\). This notation may also be used for second derivatives: \(f''(z) = \frac{d}{dz}\left[\frac{df}{dz}\right] = \frac{d^2 f}{dz^2}=\frac{d^2}{dz^2}[f]\).%
\par

In what follows, we'll build a repertoire of functions for which we can quickly compute the derivative.%

So far, we know the derivative formula for two important classes of functions: constant functions and power functions. If \(f(x) = c\) is a constant function, its graph is a horizontal line with slope zero at every point. Thus, \(\frac{d}{dx}[c] = 0\). We summarize this with the following rule.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1286}{}%
\index{derivative!constant function} \begin{assemblage}[Derivatives of Constant Functions]\label{const-fxns}
\hypertarget{p-1287}{}%
For any real number \(c\), if \(f(x) = c\), then \(f'(x) = 0\).%
\end{assemblage}
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-73}
\hypertarget{p-1288}{}%
If \(f(x) = 7\), then \(f'(x) = 0\). Similarly, \(\frac{d}{dx} [\sqrt{3}] = 0\).%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-1289}{}%
In your work in \hyperref[PA-2-1]{Example~\ref{PA-2-1}}, you conjectured that for any positive integer \(n\), if \(f(x) = x^n\), then \(f'(x) = nx^{n-1}\). This rule can be formally proved for any positive integer \(n\), and also for any nonzero real number (positive or negative).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1290}{}%
\index{derivative!power function} \begin{assemblage}[Derivatives of Power Functions]\label{power-fxns}
\hypertarget{p-1291}{}%
For any nonzero real number \(n\), if \(f(x) = x^n\), then \(f'(x) = nx^{n-1}\).%
\end{assemblage}
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-74}
\hypertarget{p-1292}{}%
 Using the rule for power functions, we can compute the following derivatives. If \(g(z) = z^{-3}\), then \(g'(z) = -3z^{-4}\). Similarly, if \(h(t) = t^{\frac{7}{5}}\), then \(\frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{7}{5}t^{\frac{2}{5}}\), and \(\frac{d}{dq} [q^{\pi}] = \pi q^{\pi - 1}\).%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-1293}{}%
It will be instructive to have a derivative formula for one more type of basic function. For now, we simply state this rule without explanation or justification. We will encounter graphical reasoning for why the rule is plausible in \hyperref[PA-2-2]{Example~\ref{PA-2-2}}, and we will further explore why this rule is true in one of the exercises.%
\par

\index{derivative!exponential function} \begin{assemblage}[Derivatives of Exponential Functions]\label{exp-fxns}
\hypertarget{p-1295}{}%
For any positive real number \(a\), if \(f(x) = a^x\), then \(f'(x) = a^x \ln(a)\).%
\end{assemblage}
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-75}
\hypertarget{p-1296}{}%
If \(f(x) = 2^x\), then \(f'(x) = 2^x \ln(2)\). Similarly, for \(p(t) = 10^t\), \(p'(t) = 10^t \ln(10)\). It is especially important to note that when \(a = e\), where \(e\) is the base of the natural logarithm function, we have that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx} [e^x] = e^x \ln(e) = e^x
\end{equation*}
since \(\ln(e) = 1\). This is an extremely important property of the function \(e^x\): it is its own derivative!%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-1297}{}%
Note carefully the distinction between power functions and exponential functions: in power functions, the variable is in the base, as in \(x^2\), while in exponential functions, the variable is in the exponent, as in \(2^x\). As we can see from the rules, this makes a big difference in the form of the derivative.%

Looking at the tangent line to \(g\) at \(x=-2\), we see that on the interval \(-3\le x\le 2\) the line rises by a little less than \(1\) unit. This gives us a slope of approximately \(0.8/5\) or \(0.9/5\), so we'll average those and say the slope of the tangent line to \(y=g(x)\) at \(x=-2\) is approximately \(0.17\).%
\item{}Looking at the tangent line to \(g\) at \(x=-1\), we see that on the interval \(-1\le x\le 2\) the line rises by about \(1\) unit. This gives us a slope of approximately \(1/3\approx0.33\).%
\item{}Looking at the tangent line to \(g\) at \(x=0\), we see that the line rises by \(2\) units over the approximate interval \(0\le x\le2.8\), giving us a slope of about \(2/2.8\approx0.71\) for this line.%
\item{}Looking at the tangent line to \(g\) at \(x=1\), we see that the line rises by just over \(4\) units on the interval \(0\le x\le 3\). This tells us the slope should be just over \(4/3\), possibly around \(1.4\).%
\item{}Looking at the tangent line to \(g\) at \(x=2\), we see that the line rises by \(4\) units on about the interval \(0.5\le x\le 2\), so the slope of this line is approximately \(4/1.5\approx2.67\).%
\end{itemize}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-860}{}\hypertarget{p-1352}{}%
The limit definition of \(g'(0)\) says%
\begin{equation*}
g'(0)=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{g(0+h)-g(0)}{h}=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{2^h-2^0}{h}=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{2^h-1}{h}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
We consider this difference quotient at the values \(h=0.1\), \(h=0.01\), and \(h=0.001\), and find that%
\begin{align*}
\frac{2^{0.1}-1}{0.1}\approx\mathstrut \amp 0.7177\\
\frac{2^{0.01}-1}{0.01}\approx\mathstrut \amp 0.6956\\
\frac{2^{0.001}-1}{0.001}\approx\mathstrut \amp 0.6933\text{.}
\end{align*}
Hence we approximate \(g'(0)\) by \(0.693\), which is very close to our slope estimate of \(0.71\) from (b) for the tangent line to \(y=g(x)\) at \(x=0\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-861}{}\hypertarget{p-1353}{}%
We start with the \(y\)-intercept of \(g'\) that we found in part (c): the point \((0,0.693)\). Then, since the slope of the tangent line to \(g\) at a point \(x=a\) is exactly the value of \(g'(a)\), we use our slope estimates from (b) to add more points to our graph:%
\begin{equation*}
(-2,0.17),~ (-1,0.33),~ (1,1.4),~ (2,2.67)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Finally, since the graph of \(y=g(x)\) is always increasing and concave up, we know the graph of \(y=g'(x)\) will be always positive and increasing. Thus we end up with the sketch shown below.%
\begin{figure}
\centering

\end{figure}
\item\hypertarget{li-862}{}\hypertarget{p-1354}{}%
Multiplying a function \(g\) by a positive constant \(c\) affects the graph of \(y=g(x)\) by vertically stretching it if \(1\lt c\), or by vertically compressing it if \(0\lt c\lt 1\). The shapes of the graphs of \(y=g(x)\) and \(y=g'(x)\) are very similar, and it looks like the derivative graph is a slightly flattened version of the graph of \(y=g(x)\). This suggests \(g'(x)=c\cdot g(x)\) for some constant \(c\) between \(0\) and \(1\). In particular, we note that \(\ln(2)\approx0.693\). Since this is the approximation we found for \(g'(0)\), where \(g(0)=1\), it is reasonable to assume that a formula for \(g'\) is \(g'(x)=\ln(2)\cdot g(x)=2^x\ln(2)\).%

\hypertarget{p-1355}{}%
Next we will learn how to compute the derivative of a function constructed as an algebraic combination of basic functions. For instance, we'd like to be able to take the derivative of a polynomial function such as%
\begin{equation*}
p(t) = 3t^5 - 7t^4 + t^2 - 9\text{,}
\end{equation*}
which is a sum of constant multiples of powers of \(t\). To that end, we develop two new rules: the constant multiple rule and the sum rule.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1356}{}%
With the constant multiple rule, we want to answer the question ``how is the derivative of \(y = kf(x)\) related to the derivative of \(y = f(x)\)?'' Recall that when we multiply a function by a constant \(k\), we vertically stretch the graph by a factor of \(|k|\) (and reflect the graph across the horizontal line \(y = 0\) if \(k \lt 0\)). This vertical stretch affects the slope of the graph, so the slope of the function \(y = kf(x)\) is \(k\) times as steep as the slope of \(y = f(x)\). Thus, when we multiply a function by a factor of \(k\), we change the value of its derivative by a factor of \(k\) as well.\footnote{We note that the constant multiple rule can be formally proved as a consequence of properties of limits, using the limit definition of the derivative.\label{fn-10}}%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1357}{}%
\index{derivative!constant multiple rule} \begin{assemblage}[The Constant Multiple Rule]\label{const-mult-rule}
\hypertarget{p-1358}{}%
For any real number \(k\), if \(f(x)\) is a differentiable function with derivative \(f'(x)\), then%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx}[k f(x)] = k f'(x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{assemblage}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1359}{}%
In words, this rule says that ``the derivative of a constant times a function is the constant times the derivative of the function.''%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-78}
\hypertarget{p-1360}{}%
If \(g(t) = 3 \cdot 5^t\), then\footnote{Be careful with this one! \(3\cdot 5^t\) is \emph{not} the same as \(15^t\). An easy way to see the difference is to substitute \(t=2\) into each expression: \(g(2)=3\cdot 5^2=3\cdot25=75\); whereas \(15^2=225\).\label{fn-11}} \(g'(t) = 3 \cdot 5^t \ln(5)\). Similarly, \(\frac{d}{dz} [5z^{-2}] = 5 (-2z^{-3})=-10z^{-3}\).%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-1361}{}%
Next we examine a sum of two functions. If we have \(y = f(x)\) and \(y = g(x)\), we can compute a new function \(y = (f+g)(x)\) by adding the outputs of the two functions: \((f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)\). Not only is the value of the new function the sum of the values of the two known functions, but the slope of the new function is the sum of the slopes of the known functions. Therefore,\footnote{Like the constant multiple rule, the sum rule can be formally proved as a consequence of properties of limits, using the limit definition of the derivative.\label{fn-12}} we arrive at the following sum rule for derivatives:%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1362}{}%
\begin{assemblage}[The Sum Rule]\label{sum-rule}
\hypertarget{p-1363}{}%
\index{derivative!sum rule} If \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\) are differentiable functions with derivatives \(f'(x)\) and \(g'(x)\) respectively, then%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx}[f(x) + g(x)] = f'(x) + g'(x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{assemblage}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1364}{}%
In words, the sum rule tells us that ``the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives.'' It also tells us that a sum of two differentiable functions is also differentiable. Furthermore, because we can view the difference function \(y = (f-g)(x) = f(x) - g(x)\) as \(y = f(x) + (-1 \cdot g(x))\), the sum rule and constant multiple rules together tell us that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx}\left[f(x)-g(x)\right]=\frac{d}{dx}\left[f(x) + (-1 \cdot g(x))\right] = f'(x) - g'(x)\text{,}
\end{equation*}
or that ``the derivative of a difference is the difference of the derivatives.'' We can now compute derivatives of sums and differences of elementary functions.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-79}
\hypertarget{p-1365}{}%
Using the sum rule, we find that \(\frac{d}{dw} (2^w + w^2) = 2^w \ln(2) + 2w\). Using both the sum and constant multiple rules, if \(h(q) = 3q^6 - 4q^{-3}\), then \(h'(q) = 3 (6q^5) - 4(-3q^{-4}) = 18q^5 + 12q^{-4}\).%
\end{example}

Use only the rules for constant, power, and exponential functions, together with the constant multiple and sum rules, to compute the derivative of each function below with respect to the given independent variable.

This means that you may have to first do some algebra on the functions below before you can actually use existing rules to compute the desired derivative formula.

In the same way that we have shortcut rules to help us find derivatives, we introduce some language that is simpler and shorter. Often, rather than say ``take the derivative of \(f\),'' we'll instead say simply ``differentiate \(f\).'' Similarly, if the derivative exists at a point, we say ``\(f\) is differentiable at that point,'' or that \(f\) can be differentiated there.%

As we work with the algebraic structure of functions, it is important to develop a big picture view of what we are doing. Here, we make several general observations based on the rules we have so far. \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}The derivative of any polynomial function is another polynomial function, and the degree of the derivative is one less than the degree of the original function. For instance, if \(p(t) = 7t^5 - 4t^3 + 8t\), then \(p\) is a degree 5 polynomial and its derivative, \(p'(t) = 35t^4 - 12t^2 + 8\), is a degree 4 polynomial.%
\item{}The derivative of any exponential function is another exponential function: for example, if \(g(z) = 7 \cdot 2^z\), then \(g'(z) = 7 \cdot 2^z \ln(2)\), which is also exponential.%
\item{}We should not lose sight of the fact that everything we developed in \hyperref[C-1]{Chapter~\ref{C-1}} regarding the meaning of the derivative still holds. The derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of the original function as well as the slope of the tangent line at any selected point on the curve.%

Note that since \(h(z) = z^{\frac{1}{2}} + z^{-1}\), we have \(h'(z) = \frac{1}{2}z^{-\frac{1}{2}} - z^{-2}=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{z}}-\frac{1}{z^2}\). Thus, \(h'(4) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt4} - \frac{1}{4^2} = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{16} = \frac{3}{16}\). Therefore the slope of the tangent line to the graph of \(y=h(z)\) at the point where \(z = 4\) is \(\frac{3}{16}\).%

Note that \(P'(t) = 2(1.37)^t \ln(1.37)\), and therefore \(P'(4) = 2(1.37)^4 \ln(1.37) \approx 2.218\) million cells per day.%
\item\hypertarget{li-913}{}\hypertarget{p-1425}{}%
We can compute \(P''(t)\) by taking the derivative of \(P'(t)\), and we find that \(P''(t) = 2(1.37)^t \ln(1.37) \ln(1.37)\). Then we see that \(P''(4) \approx 0.69825\) is positive, which tells us that \(P'(t)\) is increasing at \(t = 4\). Since the instantaneous rate of change of \(P\) is (positive and) increasing, it follows that the population is growing at an increasing rate on the fourth day.%

Given \(p(a) = 3a^4 - 2a^3 + 7a^2 - a + 12\), first observe that \(p(-1) = 3 + 2 + 7 + 1 + 12 = 25\), so the tangent line will pass through the point \((-1,25)\). Furthermore, since \(p'(a) = 12a^3 - 6a^2 + 14a - 1\), we know that the slope of the tangent line is \(p'(-1) = -12 - 6 - 14 - 1 = -33\). An equation of the tangent line is therefore \(y - 25 = -33(a+1)\). Equivalently, \(y=-33a-8\) is an equation of this tangent line.%
\item\hypertarget{li-915}{}\hypertarget{p-1427}{}%
Finding the slope of the tangent line only requires knowing the value of the derivative at a particular input. In contrast, finding the equation of the tangent line additionally requires knowing the value of the original function at that same input. In other words, the slope is just a number, whereas the equation incorporates additional information that \textemdash{} together with the slope \textemdash{} is sufficient to actually graph the tangent line.%

Given a differentiable function \(y = f(x)\), we can express the derivative of \(f\) in several different notations: \(f'(x)\), \(\frac{df}{dx}\), \(\frac{dy}{dx}\), and \(\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)]\).%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-1430}{}%
The limit definition of the derivative leads to patterns among certain families of functions. These patterns enable us to compute derivative formulas without resorting directly to the definition. For example, if \(f\) is a power function of the form \(f(x) = x^n\) for any real number \(n\) other than 0, then \(f'(x) = nx^{n-1}\). This is called the rule for power functions.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-1431}{}%
We have stated a rule for derivatives of exponential functions in the same spirit as the rule for power functions: for any positive real number \(a\), if \(f(x) = a^x\), then \(f'(x) = a^x \ln(a)\). The graphical exploration in \hyperref[PA-2-2]{Example~\ref{PA-2-2}} provides visual evidence for this rule as it shows that for an exponential function \(f(x)=a^x\) \((a \gt 1)\), the graph of \(y=f'(x)\) appears to be a scaled version of the original function. In particular, careful analysis of the graph of \(y=2^x\) suggests that \(\frac{d}{dx}[2^x]=2^x\ln(2)\).%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-1432}{}%
If we are given a constant multiple of a function whose derivative we know, or a sum of functions whose derivatives we know, the constant multiple and sum rules make it straightforward to compute the derivative of the overall function. More formally, if \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\) are differentiable with derivatives \(f'(x)\) and \(g'(x)\) and if \(a\) and \(b\) are constants, then%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx} \left[af(x) + bg(x)\right] = af'(x) + bg'(x)\text{.}

First, since \(h(x) = 3f(x) - 4g(x)\), we know \(h(2) = 3f(2) - 4g(2) = 3(5) - 4(-3) = 27\). Next, by the sum and constant multiple rules, \(h'(x) = 3f'(x) - 4g'(x)\). Hence, using the given derivative values, \(h'(2) = 3f'(2) - 4g'(2) = 3(-1/2) - 4(2) = -19/2\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-929}{}\hypertarget{p-1445}{}%
The tangent line at the point \((2,h(2))\) has equation \(L(x) = h(2) + h'(2)(x-2)\). Using the information determined in (a), we see \(L(x) = 27 - \frac{19}{2}(x-2)\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-930}{}\hypertarget{p-1446}{}%
Since \(p(x) = -2f(x) + \frac{1}{2}g(x)\), it follows that \(p'(x) = -2f'(x) + \frac{1}{2}g'(x)\) by the sum and constant multiple rules. Using the given function and derivative values for \(f\) and \(g\) at \(x=2\), we see that \(p(2) = -2f(2) + \frac{1}{2}g(2) = -2(5) + \frac{1}{2}(-3) = -\frac{23}{2}\) and \(p'(2) = -2(-\frac{1}{2}) + \frac{1}{2}(2)) = 2\). Since \(p'(2) = 2 \gt 0\), we conclude that \(p\) is increasing at \(x=2\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-931}{}\hypertarget{p-1447}{}%
First, the linearization of \(p\) at \(a = 2\) is \(L(x) = p(2) + p'(2)(x-2) = -\frac{23}{2} + 2(x-2)\). Using the linearization to estimate \(p(2.03)\), we find that%

The function \(p\) is differentiable at points where its graph is locally linear or smooth. Since there are sharp corners in the graph of \(p\) at \(x=-1\) and \(x=1\), we see that \(p\) is not differentiable at those points. Similarly, the sharp corners in \(q\) at \(x=-1\) and \(x=1\) mean that \(q\) is not differentiable at these points, either.%
\item\hypertarget{li-941}{}\hypertarget{p-1461}{}%

\item\hypertarget{li-942}{}\hypertarget{p-1462}{}%
Using the sum and scalar multiple rules, we have \(r'(x) = p'(x) + 2q'(x)\). The slope of \(p\) at \(x=-2\) is \(-2\) and the slope of \(q\) at \(x=-2\) is \(3\), so \(p'(-2) = -2\) and \(q'(-2) = 3\). It follows that \('(-2) = p'(-2) + 2q'(-2) = (-2) + 2(3) = 4\). Similarly, the slope of \(p\) at \(x=0\) is \(1\) and the slope of \(q\) at \(x=0\) is \(0\), so \(p'(0) = 1\) and \(q'(0) = 0\). It follows that \(r'(0) = p'(0) + 2q'(0) = (1) + 2(0) = 1\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-943}{}\hypertarget{p-1463}{}%
Note that \(r(2) = p(2)+2q(2) = 2+2(1) = 4\) and \(r'(2) = p'(2)+2q'(2) = 2+2(-1) = 0\). Thus, the line tangent to the graph of \(r\) at \(x=2\) is \(y = r(2) + r'(2)(x-2) = 4\).%

We see that \(w(\frac{1}{2}) = 3(\frac{1}{2})^{\frac{1}{2}} - 2\arccos(\frac{1}{2}) = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - 2 \cdot \frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{2\pi}{3}\). Similarly,%
\begin{align*}
w'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) &= 3\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\left(\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 1\right) + 2\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(\frac{1}{2})^2}}\\
&= \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 1\right) + \frac{4}{\sqrt{3}}\text{.}

Using these values, we find that the tangent line to \(w\) at the point \((\frac{1}{2},w(\frac{1}{2})\) is%
\begin{equation*}
L(t) = w\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + w'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(t-\frac{1}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{2\pi}{3}\right) + \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 1\right) + \frac{4}{\sqrt{3}}\right)(t-2)\text{.}

To determine whether \(v\) is increasing or decreasing at \(t = \frac{1}{2}\), we compute \(v'(\frac{1}{2})\). First, \(v'(t) = t^t(\ln(t) + 1) + \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-t^2}}\). Hence,%

v'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\left(\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 1\right) + \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(\frac{1}{2})^2}}\text{.}

By experimenting, we see first that \(a \approx 2.7\) (for which \(L \approx 0.993\), so \(a\) needs to be slightly bigger than \(2.7\)). Continuing to try values of \(a\) that result in \(L\) being closer and closer to \(1\), we find \(a \approx 2.71828\) (for which \(L \approx 1.000\))%
\item\hypertarget{li-969}{}\hypertarget{p-1495}{}%
We note that \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\) and \(\ln(3) \approx 1.0986\). Since these values correspond to the values of%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{a^{h}-1}{h}
\end{equation*}
when \(a = 2\) and \(a = 3\), we conjecture that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx}[2^x] = 2^x \cdot \ln(2)
\end{equation*}
and%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx}[3^x] = 3^x \cdot \ln(3)
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-970}{}\hypertarget{p-1496}{}%
Our work suggests that \(\frac{d}{dx}[a^x] = a^x \cdot \ln(a)\), and when \(a = e \approx 2.71828\), it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx}[e^x] = e^x \cdot \ln(e) = e^x
\end{equation*}
Thus, \(e^x\) is a very special function: its derivative is itself!%

\begin{equation*}
\text{if}~ f(x) = x^n,~ \text{then}~ f'(x) = nx^{n-1}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and the rule for exponential functions:%

\text{if}~ a ~ \text{is a positive real number and}~ f(x) = a^x,~
\text{then}~ f'(x) = a^x \ln(a)\text{.}

The sine and cosine functions are among the most important functions in all of mathematics.  These periodic functions play a key role in modeling repeating phenomena such as tidal elevations, the behavior of an oscillating mass attached to a spring, or the location of a point on a bicycle tire. Like polynomial and exponential functions, the sine and cosine functions are considered basic functions, ones that are often used in building more complicated functions. As such, we would like to know formulas for \(\frac{d}{dx} [\sin(x)]\) and \(\frac{d}{dx} [\cos(x)]\), and the next two examples lead us to that end.%

Because we cannot simplify the fraction \(\frac{\sin(h)}{h}\) any further algebraically, we estimate the value of the limit using small values of \(h\).

The exact slope of the tangent line to the graph of \(y = f(x)\) at \(x = \frac{\pi}{6}\) is given by \(f'\big(\frac{\pi}{6}\big)\). So, we first compute \(f'(x)\). Since \(f(x)=2x+\frac{\sin(x)}{2}\), we may use the sum and constant multiple rules to find \(f'(x) = 2 + \frac{1}{2}\cos(x)\). Thus%

We observe first that \(g\big(\frac{\pi}{2}\big) = \big(\frac{\pi}{2}\big)^2 + 2\cos\big(\frac{\pi}{2}\big) = \frac{\pi^2}{4}\). Next, we compute the derivative function, \(g'(x)\), and find that%
\begin{align*}
g'(x)=\mathstrut \amp \frac{d}{dx}[x^2]+2\frac{d}{dx}[\cos(x)]\\

Thus \(g'\big(\frac{\pi}{2}\big) = 2 \cdot \frac{\pi}{2} - 2 \sin\big(\frac{\pi}{2}\big) = \pi - 2\). Hence, the equation of the tangent line (in point-slope form) is given by%

We first use the power rule to find \(\frac{d}{dz}[z^4]=4z^3\). We then use the rule for exponential functions to find \(\frac{d}{dz}[4^z]=4^z\ln(4)\), and the rule for cosine and constant multiples to compute \(\frac{d}{dz}[4\cos(z)]=4[-\sin(z)]=-4\sin(z)\). Finally, using the sum rule and noting that \(\sin\big(\frac{\pi}{2}\big)\) is a constant, we have%
\begin{equation*}
p'(z) = 4z^3 + 4^z \ln(4) - 4\sin(z)\text{.}

The value of \(P'(2)\) will tell us the instantaneous rate of change of \(P\) at the instant two decades have elapsed. Observe that \(P'(t) = 8\cos(t)\), and thus \(P'(2) = 8\cos(2) \approx -3.329\) hundred animals per decade. This tells us that the instantaneous rate of change of \(P\) on January 1, 2030 is about \(-333\) animals per decade, which tells us that the animal population is shrinking moderately at this point in time. We might say that for whatever the population is on January 1, 2030, we expect that population to drop by about 333 animals over the next ten years if the current population trend continues.%

January 1, 2012 corresponds to the instant \(t = 2\), so we compute \(V'(2)\). First, we observe by the sum and constant multiple rules that \(V'(t) = 24 \cdot 1.07^t \cdot \ln(1.07) + 6 \cos(t)\). Thus, \(V'(2) = 24 \cdot 1.07^2 \cdot \ln(1.07) + 6 \cos(2) \approx -0.63778\). Since \(V\) is measured in thousands of dollars and \(t\) in years, we know that the portfolio's value is decreasing at a rate of \(637.78\) dollars per year on January 1, 2012.%
\item\hypertarget{li-1042}{}\hypertarget{p-1592}{}%
Since \(V'(t) = 24 \cdot 1.07^t \cdot \ln(1.07) + 6 \cos(t)\), it follows that \(V''(t) = 24 \cdot 1.07^t \cdot (\ln(1.07))^2 - 6 \sin(t)\), and thus \(V''(2) = 24 \cdot 1.07^2 \cdot \ln(1.07)^2 - 6 \sin(2) \approx -5.33\), with units ``thousands of dollars per year per year.'' This means that at the moment \(t = 2\), the portfolio's value is decreasing at a decreasing rate. More specifically, we know that \(V'\) is decreasing at the moment \(t = 2\) and expect the derivative's value to decrease by about \(5.33\) thousand dollars per year over the course of the next year. In other words, the portfolio's value is not only decreasing, but we expect it to decrease more rapidly as the year goes on.%
\item\hypertarget{li-1043}{}\hypertarget{p-1593}{}%
In the figure below, we see plots of both \(V\) and \(A\) along with their corresponding derivatives. We see that the function \(A\) is a purely exponential function that always increases at an increasing rate. By adding the term \(6\sin(t)\) to \(A\) to create the function \(V\), we add volatility to the value of the portfolio: the oscillating nature of the sine function not only creates variance in the stock's value, but also in its rate of change. We also observe that as time progresses and the value of \(24 \cdot (1.07)^t\) increases, the effect of \(6 \sin(t)\) lessens.%

The slope of the line tangent to the graph of \(f\) at \(a = \frac{\pi}{4}\) is given by \(f'\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)\). To find \(f'\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)\) we first find \(f'(x)\), which is \(f'(x) = -3\sin(x) - 2\cos(x)\). Thus,%
\begin{align*}
f'\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) &= -3\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) - 2\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)\\
& -3\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) - 3\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) = -5\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-1053}{}\hypertarget{p-1606}{}%
The linearization \(L(x)\) to \(f\) at \(a = \pi\) is \(L(x) = f(\pi) + f'(\pi)(x-\pi)\). We calculated \(f'(x)\) in part (a) and so \(f'(\pi) = -3\sin(\pi) - 2\cos(\pi) = 2\). We also have \(f(\pi) = 3\cos(\pi) - 2\sin(\pi) + 6 = 3\). Hence \(L(x) = 3+2(x-\pi)\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-1054}{}\hypertarget{p-1607}{}%
A differentiable function \(f\) is increasing at \(x=a\) if and only if \(f'(a) \gt 0\) and decreasing if and only if \(f'(a) \lt 0\). Now \(f'\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = -3\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) - 2\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = -3\), so \(f\) is decreasing at \(a = \frac{\pi}{2}\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-1055}{}\hypertarget{p-1608}{}%
If a curve defined by a function \(f\) is concave up at \(x=a\), then the tangent line to \(f\) at \(x=a\) lies below the curve and if the graph of \(f\) is concave down at \(x=a\), then the tangent line to \(f\) at \(x=a\) lies above the curve. The concavity of a curve is determined by the second derivative and \(f''(x) = -3\cos(x)+2\sin(x)\). Since%
\begin{equation*}
f''\left(\frac{3\pi}{2}\right) = -3\cos\left(\frac{3\pi}{2}\right) + 2\sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{2}\right) = -2\text{,}

Next, we note that \(\sin(x)\) does not depend on \(h\), and likewise \(\cos(x)\) is independent of \(h\). It thus makes sense to view those constants as being outside the limit being taken, and also that the limit of a sum is the sum of the limits. Hence we write%
\begin{equation*}
f'(x) = \sin(x) \cdot \lim_{h \to 0} \left( \frac{\cos(h)-1}{h} \right)  + \cos(x) \cdot \lim_{h \to 0} \left( \frac{\sin(h)}{h} \right)\text{.}

So far, we can differentiate power functions \(x^n\), exponential functions \(a^x\), and the two fundamental trigonometric functions \(\sin(x)\) and \(\cos(x)\). With the sum rule and constant multiple rules, we can also compute the derivative of combined functions.%

\subsection[{The Product Rule}]{The Product Rule}\label{subsection-55}
\hypertarget{p-1662}{}%
As part (b) of \hyperref[PA-2-3]{Example~\ref{PA-2-3}} shows, it is not true in general that the derivative of a product of two functions is the product of the derivatives of those functions. To see why this is the case, we consider a situation involving functions with physical context.%
\begin{example}[]\label{stock-share}
\hypertarget{p-1663}{}%
Say that an investor is regularly purchasing stock in a particular company. Let \(N(t)\) represent the number of shares owned on day \(t\), where \(t = 0\) represents the first day on which shares were purchased. Let \(S(t)\) give the value of one share of the stock on day \(t\); note that the units on \(S(t)\) are dollars per share. To compute the total value of the stock on day \(t\), we take the product%
\begin{equation*}
V(t) = N(t) \, \text{shares}  \cdot S(t) \, \text{dollars per share}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
Observe that over time, both the number of shares and the value of a given share will vary. The derivative \(N'(t)\) measures the rate at which the number of shares is changing, while \(S'(t)\) measures the rate at which the value per share is changing. How do these respective rates of change affect the rate of change of the total value function?%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1664}{}%
To help us understand the relationship among changes in \(N\), \(S\), and \(V\), let's consider some specific data. \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}Suppose that on day 100, the investor owns 520 shares of stock and the stock's current value is \textdollar{}27.50 per share. This tells us that \(N(100) = 520\) and \(S(100) = 27.50\).%
\item{}On day 100, the investor purchases an additional 12 shares (so the number of shares held is rising at a rate of 12 shares per day).%
\item{}On that same day the price of the stock is rising at a rate of 0.75 dollars per share per day.%
\end{itemize}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1665}{}%
In calculus notation, the latter two facts tell us that \(N'(100) = 12\) (shares per day) and \(S'(100) = 0.75\) (dollars per share per day). At what rate is the value of the investor's total holdings changing on day 100?%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1666}{}%
Observe that the increase in total value comes from two sources: the growing number of shares and the rising value of each share.%
\leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-1667}{}%
If only the number of shares is increasing (and the value of each share is constant), the rate at which the total value would rise is the product of the rate at which the number of shares is changing and the current value of the shares. That is, the rate at which the total value would change when the share value is constant is given by%
\begin{equation*}
N'(100) \cdot S(100) =  12 \, \frac{\text{shares}}{\text{day}} \cdot 27.50 \, \frac{\text{dollars}}{\text{share}} = 330 \, \frac{\text{dollars} }{\text{day} }\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1668}{}%
Note particularly how the units make sense and show the rate at which the total value \(V\) is changing, measured in dollars per day.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-1669}{}%
If instead the number of shares is constant, but the value of each share is rising, the rate at which the total value would rise is  the product of the number of shares and the rate of change of share value. In this case, the total value is rising at a rate of%
\begin{equation*}
N(100) \cdot S'(100) = 520 \, \text{shares}  \cdot 0.75 \, \frac{\text{dollars per share} }{\text{day} } = 390 \, \frac{\text{dollars} }{\text{day} }\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-1670}{}%
Of course, when both the number of shares and the value of each share are changing, we have to include both of these sources. In that case the rate at which the total value is rising is%
\begin{equation*}
V'(100) =  N'(100) \cdot S(100) + N(100) \cdot S'(100) = 330 + 390 = 720 \, \frac{\text{dollars} }{\text{day} }\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{itemize}
\hypertarget{p-1671}{}%
We expect the total value of the investor's holdings to rise by about \textdollar{}720 on the 100th day.\footnote{While this example highlights why the product rule is true, there are some subtle issues to recognize. For one, if the stock's value really does rise exactly \textdollar{}0.75 on day 100, and the number of shares really rises by 12 on day 100, then we would expect that \(V(101) = N(101) \cdot S(101) = 532 \cdot 28.25 = 15,029\). If, as noted above, we expect the total value to rise by \textdollar{}720, then with \(V(100) = N(100) \cdot S(100) = 520 \cdot 27.50 = 14,300\), then it seems we should find that \(V(101) = V(100) + 720 = 15,020\). Why do the two results differ by 9? One way to understand why this difference occurs is to recognize that \(N'(100) = 12\) represents an \emph{instantaneous} rate of change, while our (informal) discussion has also thought of this number as the total change in the number of shares over the course of a single day. The formal proof of the product rule reconciles this issue by taking the limit as the change in the input tends to zero.\label{fn-14}}%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-1672}{}%
Next, we expand our perspective from the specific example above to the more general and abstract setting of a product \(P\) of two differentiable functions, \(f\) and \(g\). If \(P(x) = f(x) \cdot g(x)\), our work above suggests that \(P'(x) = f'(x) g(x) + f(x) g'(x)\). Indeed, a formal proof using the limit definition of the derivative can be given to show that the following rule, called the \terminology{product rule}, holds in general.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1673}{}%
\begin{assemblage}[Product Rule]\label{prod-rule}
\hypertarget{p-1674}{}%
\index{product rule} \index{derivative!product rule} If \(f\) and \(g\) are differentiable functions, then their product \(P(x) = f(x) \cdot g(x)\) is also a differentiable function, and%

P'(x) = f'(x) g(x) + f(x) g'(x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{assemblage}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1675}{}%
In light of \hyperref[stock-share]{Example~\ref{stock-share}} involving shares of stock, the product rule also makes sense intuitively: the rate of change of \(P\) should take into account both how fast \(f\) and \(g\) are changing, as well as how large \(f\) and \(g\) are at the point of interest. In words, the product rule says: if \(P\) is the product of two functions \(f\) (the first function) and \(g\) (the second), then ``the derivative of \(P\) is the derivative of the first times the second, plus the first times the derivative of the second.'' It is often a helpful mental exercise to say this phrasing aloud when executing the product rule.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-88}
\hypertarget{p-1676}{}%
If \(P(z) = z^3 \cdot \cos(z)\), we can use the product rule to differentiate \(P\). The first function is \(z^3\) and the second function is \(\cos(z)\). By the product rule, \(P'\) will be given by the derivative of the first, \(3z^2\), times the second, \(\cos(z)\), plus the first, \(z^3\), times the derivative of the second, \(-\sin(z)\). That is,%
\begin{equation*}
P'(z) = 3z^2\cos(z)+z^3(-\sin(z)) = 3z^2 \cos(z)-z^3\sin(z)\text{.}

\subsection[{The Quotient Rule}]{The Quotient Rule}\label{subsection-56}
\hypertarget{p-1697}{}%
Because quotients and products are closely linked, we can use the product rule to understand how to take the derivative of a quotient. Let \(Q(x)\) be defined by \(Q(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\), where \(f\) and \(g\) are both differentiable functions. It turns out that \(Q\) is differentiable everywhere that \(g(x) \ne 0\). We would like a formula for \(Q'\) in terms of \(f\), \(g\), \(f'\), and \(g'\). Multiplying both sides of the equation \(Q = \frac{f}{g}\) by \(g\), we observe that%
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = Q(x) \cdot g(x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1698}{}%
Now we can use the product rule to differentiate \(f\):%
\begin{equation*}
f'(x) = Q'(x) g(x) + Q(x)g'(x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1699}{}%
We want to know a formula for \(Q'\), so we solve this equation for \(Q'(x)\). Then%
\begin{equation*}
Q'(x) g(x) = f'(x) - Q(x) g'(x)\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and dividing both sides by \(g(x)\), we have%
\begin{equation*}
Q'(x) = \frac{f'(x) - Q(x) g'(x)}{g(x)}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1700}{}%
Finally, we recall that \(Q(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\). Substituting this expression in the preceding equation, we have%
\begin{align*}
Q'(x) =\mathstrut \amp  \frac{f'(x) - \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} g'(x)}{g(x)}\\

As with the product rule, it can be helpful to think of the quotient rule verbally. If a function \(Q\) is the quotient of a top function \(f\) and a bottom function \(g\), then \(Q'\) is given by ``the derivative of the top times the bottom, minus the top times the derivative of the bottom, all over the bottom squared.''\footnote{If you have studied differentiation before, you may have seen this rule as \(\frac{d}{dx}\left[\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right]=\frac{g(x)f'(x)-f(x)g'(x)}{[g(x)]^2}\), with the mnemonic "``low-d-high minus high-d-low all over low squared.''" If this version is more comfortable for you, you are welcome to use it instead.\label{fn-15}}%

If \(Q(t) = \frac{\sin(t)}{2^t}\), we call  \(\sin(t)\) the top function and \(2^t\) the bottom function. By the quotient rule, \(Q'\) is given by the derivative of the top, \(\cos(t)\), times the bottom, \(2^t\), minus the top, \(\sin(t)\), times the derivative of the bottom, \(2^t \ln(2)\), all over the bottom squared, \((2^t)^2\). That is,%

Thus, \(I'(0.5) = \frac{50}{e^{0.5}} \approx 30.327\), \(I'(2) = \frac{-100}{e^{2}} \approx -13.534\), and \(I'(5) = \frac{-400}{e^4} \approx -2.695\), each measured in candles per millisecond. These results show that at \(t = 0.5\), the intensity of the flash is increasing rapidly, while at \(t = 2\) and \(t = 5\), the intensity is decreasing, with the intensity decreasing more rapidly when \(t = 2\).%

In addition to being used to finding the derivatives of functions given by equations, the product and quotient rule can be useful for finding the derivatives of functions given by tables and graphs.  The following examples illustrate this process.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-92}

Suppose the functions \(f\) and \(g\) are described by \hyperref[T-prod-ex]{Table~\ref{T-prod-ex}} below, and the function \(h\) is given by the formula \(h(x)=f(x)g(x)\). Then we can calculate \(h'(2)=f'(2)g(2)+f(2)g'(2)=4 \times 5 + 2 \times 6=32\).%

Then for certain values of \(x\), we can calculate%

\subsection[{Combining Rules}]{Combining Rules}\label{subsection-58}
\hypertarget{p-1732}{}%
In order to apply the derivative shortcut rules correctly we must recognize the fundamental structure of a function.%
\begin{example}[]\label{deriv-pq-1}
\hypertarget{p-1733}{}%
Determine the derivative of the function%
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = x\sin(x) + \frac{x^2}{\cos(x) + 2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
How do we decide which rules to apply? Our first task is to recognize the structure of the function. This function \(f\) is a sum of two slightly less complicated functions, so we can apply the sum rule\footnote{When taking a derivative that involves the use of multiple derivative rules, it is often helpful to use the notation \(\frac{d}{dx} \left[ ~~\right]\) to wait to apply subsequent rules. This is demonstrated in both \hyperref[deriv-pq-1]{Example~\ref{deriv-pq-1}} and \hyperref[deriv-pq-2]{Example~\ref{deriv-pq-2}}, and has come up previously in solutions to various examples in this chapter.\label{fn-16}} to get%
\begin{align*}
f'(x) =\mathstrut \amp  \frac{d}{dx} \left[ x\sin(x) + \frac{x^2}{\cos(x) + 2} \right]\\
=\mathstrut \amp  \frac{d}{dx} \left[ x\sin(x) \right] + \frac{d}{dx}\left[ \frac{x^2}{\cos(x) + 2} \right]\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1734}{}%
Now, the left-hand term above is a product, so the product rule is needed there, while the right-hand term is a quotient, so the quotient rule is required. Applying these rules respectively, we find that%
\begin{align*}
f'(x) =\mathstrut \amp  \left( \sin(x)+x \cos(x) \right) + \frac{ 2x(\cos(x) + 2) - x^2(-\sin(x))}{(\cos(x) + 2)^2}\\
=\mathstrut \amp  \sin(x) + x \cos(x) + \frac{2x\cos(x) + 4x + x^2\sin(x)}{(\cos(x) + 2)^2}\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\end{example}
\begin{example}[]\label{deriv-pq-2}
\hypertarget{p-1735}{}%
Differentiate%
\begin{equation*}
s(y) = \frac{y \cdot 7^y}{y^2 + 1}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
The function \(s\) is a quotient of two simpler functions, so the quotient rule will be needed. To begin, we set up the quotient rule and use the notation \(\frac{d}{dy}\) to indicate the derivatives of the numerator and denominator. Thus,%
\begin{equation*}
s'(y) = \frac{\frac{d}{dy}\left[ y \cdot 7^y \right]\cdot(y^2 + 1) - y \cdot 7^y \cdot \frac{d}{dy}\left[y^2 + 1 \right]}{(y^2 + 1)^2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Now, there remain two derivatives to calculate. The first one, \(\frac{d}{dy}\left[ y \cdot 7^y \right]\) calls for use of the product rule, while the second, \(\frac{d}{dy}\left[y^2 + 1 \right]\) needs only the sum rule. Applying these rules, we now have%
\begin{equation*}
s'(y) = \frac{[7^y+y \cdot 7^y \ln(7)](y^2 + 1) - y \cdot 7^y [2y]}{(y^2 + 1)^2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
While some simplification is possible, we are content to leave \(s'(y)\) in its current form.%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-1736}{}%
Success in applying derivative rules begins with recognizing the structure of the function, followed by the careful and diligent application of the relevant derivative rules. The best way to become proficient at this process is through continuous practice!%

%
\item\hypertarget{li-1150}{}\hypertarget{p-1758}{}%
Using the sum and constant multiple rules, it follows first that%
\begin{equation*}
g'(z) = 3 \frac{d}{dz}[z^7 e^z] - 2\frac{d}{dz}[z^2 \sin(z)] + \frac{d}{dz}\left[ \frac{z}{z^2 + 1} \right]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Applying the product rule in the first two terms and the quotient rule in the third, we find that%
\begin{equation*}
g'(z) = 3 [7z^6e^z+z^7 e^z] - 2[2z\sin(z)+z^2 \cos(z)] + \frac{(z^2+1)  - z(2z)}{(z^2 + 1)^2}\text{.}

The particle's instantaneous velocity at the moment \(t = 1\) is given by \(s'(1)\). We use the quotient rule to find \(s'(t)\), and then simplify by removing a common factor of \(e^t\) to get%
\begin{align*}
s'(t) =\mathstrut \amp \frac{(-3\sin(t) - \cos(t))e^t-(3\cos(t) - \sin(t))e^t}{(e^t)^2}\\
=\mathstrut \amp \frac{-2\sin(t)-4\cos(t)}{e^t}\text{.}
\end{align*}
Thus, \(s'(1) = \frac{-2\sin(1)-4\cos(1)}{e^1} \approx -1.414\), which is the particle's instantaneous velocity in feet per second at the moment \(t = 1\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-1152}{}\hypertarget{p-1760}{}%
Since \(p(x) = f(x) \cdot g(x)\), the product rule tells us%
\begin{equation*}
p'(x) = f'(x)g(x)+f(x)g'(x) \text{,}
\end{equation*}
and since \(\displaystyle q(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\), by the quotient rule we know%
\begin{equation*}
q'(x) = \frac{f'(x)g(x)-f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Using the given information (\(f(3) = -2\), \(f'(3) = 7\), \(g(3) = 4\), and  \(g'(3) = -1\)) we now see that%
\begin{equation*}
p'(3) = f'(3)g(3)+f(3)g'(3) = (7)(4)+(-2)(-1) = 30

and%
\begin{equation*}
q'(3) = \frac{f'(3)g(3)-f(3)g'(3)}{g(3)^2} = \frac{(7)(4) - (-2)(-1)}{4^2} = \frac{13}{8}\text{.}

As the algebraic complexity of the functions we are able to differentiate continues to increase, it is important to remember that the meaning of the derivative remains the same. Regardless of the structure of the function \(f\), the value of \(f'(a)\) tells us the instantaneous rate of change of \(f\) with respect to \(x\) at the moment \(x = a\), as well as the slope of the tangent line to \(y = f(x)\) at the point \((a,f(a))\).%

If a function is a sum, product, or quotient of simpler functions, then we can use the sum, product, or quotient rules to differentiate it in terms of the simpler functions and their derivatives.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-1764}{}%
The product rule tells us that if \(P\) is a product of differentiable functions \(f\) and \(g\) according to the rule \(P(x) = f(x) g(x)\), then%
\begin{equation*}
P'(x) = f'(x)g(x)+f(x)g'(x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-1765}{}%
The quotient rule tells us that if \(Q\) is a quotient of differentiable functions \(f\) and \(g\) according to the rule \(Q(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\), then whenever \(g(x)\neq0\),%
\begin{equation*}
Q'(x) = \frac{f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{[g(x)]^2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-1766}{}%
Along with the constant multiple and sum rules, the product and quotient rules enable us to compute the derivative of any function that consists of sums, constant multiples, products, and quotients of basic functions. For instance, if \(F\) has the form%
\begin{equation*}
F(x) = \frac{2a(x) - 5b(x)}{c(x) \cdot d(x)}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
then \(F\) is a quotient, in which the numerator is a sum of constant multiples (of the functions \(a\) and \(b\)), and the denominator is a product (of the functions \(c\) and \(d\)). Thus the derivative of \(F\) can be found by first applying the quotient rule, and then using the sum and constant multiple rules to differentiate the numerator, and the product rule to differentiate the denominator.%

Since \(h(x) = g(x) \cdot f(x)\), it follows \(h(2) = g(2) \cdot f(2) = (5) \cdot (-3) = -15\). Further, by the product rule, we know that \(h'(x) = g(x) \cdot f'(x) + f(x) \cdot g'(x)\). Using the given function and derivative values, \(h'(2) = g(2) \cdot f'(2) + f(2) \cdot g'(2) = (-3)(-1/2) + (5)(2) = 23/2\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-1166}{}\hypertarget{p-1779}{}%
The tangent line to \(h\) at \(a=2\) is given by \(L(x) = h(2) + h'(2)(x-2)\), so using our results from (a), we have \(L(x) = -15 + 23/2(x-2)\).%

Since \(r(x) = \frac{g(x)}{f(x)}\), but the quotient rule that \(r'(x) = \frac{f(x) \cdot g'(x) - g(x) \cdot f'(x)}{(f(x))^2}\), and thus \(r'(2) = \frac{f(2) \cdot g'(2) - g(2) \cdot f'(2)}{(f(2))^2}\). Employing the known function and derivative values, \(r'(2) = \frac{(5)(2) - (-3)(-1/2)}{(5)^2} = \frac{17/2}{25} = \frac{17}{50}\). Therefore, \(r'(2) \gt 0\), and \(r\) is increasing at \(a = 2\).%

\begin{equation*}
w(2) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}\arccos\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \approx 0.740

Using a computational device to evaluate \(v'(2)\), it follows \(v'(2) \approx 0.952\). Since this number is positive, the instantaneous rate of change of \(v\) at \(t=\frac{1}{2}\) is positive, which means that \(v\) is increasing at that instant.%

For all values of \(t\) for which , the product rule applies, and we have \(r'(x) = p(x) \cdot q'(x) + q(x) \cdot p'(x)\). Since \(p\) and \(q\) are differentiable at both \(x=-2\) and \(x=0\), we can determine the values of \(p'\) and \(q'\) at these points by computing the slope of the function (which is piecewise linear). In particular, \(p'(-2) = -2\), \(q'(-2) = 3\), \(p'(0) = 0\), and \(q'(0) = \frac{1}{2}\). In addition, we can read the values of \(p\) and \(q\) at these points from the graph: \(p(-2) = 1\), \(q(-2) = -1\), \(p(0) = \frac{1}{2}\), and \(q(0) = 2\). Thus,%
\begin{align*}
r'(-2) &= p(-2) \cdot q'(-2) + q(-2) \cdot p'(-2)\\

To find the tangent line to \(r\) at \((2,r(2))\), we first observe that \(r(2) = p(2) \cdot q(2) = 2 \cdot 1 = 2\). In addition, we know by the product rule that \(r'(2) = p(2) \cdot q'(2) + q(2) \cdot p'(2) = (2)(-1) + (1)(2) = 0\). Thus, the tangent line is given by \(L(x) = r(2) + r'(2)(x-2) = 2 + 0(x-1) = 2\).

If we multiply \(A(t)\) acres by \(Y(t)\) bushels per acre, we arrive at \(C(t) = A(t)Y(t)\) bushels as the total number of bushels of corn the farmer produces in year \(t\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-1204}{}\hypertarget{p-1827}{}%
We are given that \(A(0) = 7000\) acres with a yield of \(Y(0) = 170\) bushels per acre, giving us \(C(0) = A(0)Y(0) = (7000)(170) = 1190000\) bushels. Thus, the farmer produces \(1 190 000\) bushels of corn in the present year.%
\item\hypertarget{li-1205}{}\hypertarget{p-1828}{}%
The product rule tells us that \(C'(t) = A(t)Y'(t) + A'(t)Y(t)\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-1206}{}\hypertarget{p-1829}{}%
We know \(A(0) = 7000\) and \(Y(0) = 170\). We are also given that the farmer will increase his number of acres devoted to growing corn at a rate of \(600\) acres/year, and he expects that right now his average yield is increasing at a rate of \(8\) bushels per acre per year. This tells us that \(A'(t) = 600\) and \(Y'(0) = 8\). So%
\begin{equation*}
C'(0) = A(0)Y'(0) + A'(0)Y(0) = (7000)(8) + (600)(170) = 158 000\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Note that the units of \(A(t)\) are acres and the units of \(Y'(t)\) are bushels per acre per year. So the units of \(A(0)Y'(0)\) are bushels per year. Similarly, the units of \(A'(t)\) are acres per year and the units of \(Y(t)\) are bushels per acre, so the units of \(A'(0)Y(0)\) are also bushels per acre. So the units of \(C'(0)\) are bushels per acre. Therefore, \(C'(0) = 158 000\) tells us that the number of bushels the farmer can produce will increase by approximately \(158 000\) bushels for each year past the present year.%

Observe that the units on \(g(v)\) are ``kilometers per liter.'' Since the units on \(f(v)\) are ``liters per kilometer,'' it follows that \(g\) is the reciprocal of \(f\): \(g(v) = \frac{1}{f(v)}\). By the quotient rule, we then know that%
\begin{equation*}
g'(v) = \frac{f(v) \cdot 0 - 1 \cdot f'(v)}{f(v)^2} = -\frac{f'(v)}{f(v)^2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Further, using the given values we can say that \(g(80) = \frac{1}{f(80)} = \frac{1}{0.05} = 20\) kilometers per liter, and \(g'(80) = -\frac{f'(80)}{f(80)^2} = -\frac{0.0004}{0.05^2} = -0.16\). Note that the units on \(g'(80)\) are ``kilometers per liter per kilometer per hour.''%

Since the units on \(h(v)\) are ``liters per hour,'' and the units on \(f(v)\) are ``liters per kilometer,'' we note that if we multiply \(f(v)\) by \(v\) (whose units are ``kilometers per hour''), we get that the units on \(v \cdot f(v)\) match the units of \(h(v)\). Thus,%

h(v) = v \cdot f(v)\text{.}

h'(v) = v \cdot \frac{d}{dv}[f(v)] + \frac{d}{dv}[v] \cdot f(v) = v \cdot f'(v) + 1 \cdot f(v)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Using the known function and derivative values of \(f\), we determine that \(h(80) = 80 \cdot 0.05 = 4\) liters per hour and \(h'(80) = 80 \cdot 0.0004 + 0.05 = 0.082\) liters per hour per kilometer per hour.%
\item\hypertarget{li-1216}{}\hypertarget{p-1842}{}%
To explain the meaning of these function and derivative values to someone who doesn't know calculus, we could say something like the following: %
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-1843}{}%
The given values of \(f(80) = 0.05\) and \(f'(80) = 0.0004\) tell us that when the car is going \(80\) kilometers per hour, it is using \(0.05\) liters of fuel for every kilometer it travels. In addition, for each additional kilometer per hour of velocity above \(80\) kph, we expect that the car will use about an additional \(0.0004\) liters of fuel per kilometer.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-1844}{}%
The values of \(g(80) = 20\) and \(g'(80) = -0.16\) tell us that when the car is going \(80\) kilometers per hour, it is able to travel \(20\) kilometers for each liter of fuel used. In addition, for each additional kilometer per hour of velocity above \(80\) kph, we expect that the car will be able to travel about \(0.16\) fewer kilometers per liter of fuel.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-1845}{}%
Finally, the values of \(h(80) = 4\) and \(h'(80) = 0.82\) tell us that when the car is going \(80\) kilometers per hour, it is using \(4\) liters of fuel for every hour it travels. In addition, for each additional kilometer per hour of velocity above \(80\) kph, we expect that the car will ues about \(0.082\) more liters of fuel per hour.%
\end{itemize}
 Note that all three of these observations are saying fundamentally the same thing, just from different perspectives: the first regards fuel consumption measured in liters per kilometer; the second regards fuel consumption in kilometers per liter; and the last regards fuel consumption in liters per hour.%

\index{trigonometry}\hypertarget{p-1848}{}%
One of the powerful themes in trigonometry comes from a very simple idea: locating a point on the unit circle.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.47\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/2_4_UnitCircle.pdf}
\caption{The unit circle and the definition of the sine and cosine functions.\label{F-2-4-UnitCircle}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-1849}{}%
Because each angle \(\theta\) in standard position corresponds to one and only one point \((x,y)\) on the unit circle, the \(x\)- and \(y\)-coordinates of this point are each functions of \(\theta\). In fact, this is the very definition of \(\cos(\theta)\) and \(\sin(\theta)\) i.e. \index{trigonometry!sine} \index{trigonometry!cosine} \(\cos(\theta)\) is the \(x\)-coordinate of the point on the unit circle corresponding to the angle \(\theta\), and \(\sin(\theta)\) is the \(y\)-coordinate. From this simple definition, all of trigonometry is founded. For instance, the Pythagorean Identity, \index{trigonometry!pythagorean identity}%
\begin{equation*}
\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1\text{,}
\end{equation*}
is a restatement of the Pythagorean Theorem, applied to the right triangle shown above in \hyperref[F-2-4-UnitCircle]{Figure~\ref{F-2-4-UnitCircle}}.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1850}{}%
There are four other trigonometric functions, each defined in terms of the sine and/or cosine functions. \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}The tangent function \index{trigonometry!tangent} is defined by \(\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}\);%
\item{}the cotangent function \index{trigonometry!cotangent} is its reciprocal: \(\cot(\theta) = \frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sin(\theta)}\).%
\item{}The secant function \index{trigonometry!secant} is the reciprocal of the cosine function, \(\sec(\theta) = \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)}\);%
\item{}and the cosecant function \index{trigonometry!cosecant} is the reciprocal of the sine function, \(\csc(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sin(\theta)}\).%
\end{itemize}
 These six trigonometric functions together offer us a wide range of flexibility in problems involving right triangles.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1851}{}%
Because we know the derivatives of the sine and cosine functions, we can now develop shortcut differentiation rules for the tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant functions. In \hyperref[PA-2-4]{Example~\ref{PA-2-4}} we will work through the steps to find the derivative of \(\tan(x)\).%

Since \(\sin(x)\) is defined for every real value of \(x\) and \(\cos(x)\) is only equal to zero at odd integer multiples of \(\frac{\pi}2\), it follows that the quotient \(\tan(x)=\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}\) is defined whenever \(x\neq \ldots,-\frac{3\pi}2,-\frac{\pi}2,\frac{\pi}2,\frac{3\pi}2,\ldots\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-1242}{}\hypertarget{p-1872}{}%
Since \(f(x)=\tan(x)\) is the quotient of \(\sin(x)\) and \(\cos(x)\), then to differentiate \(f\) using the quotient rule we first need \(\frac{d}{dx}[\sin(x)]=\cos(x)\) and \(\frac{d}{dx}[\cos(x)]=-\sin(x)\). Then%
\begin{align*}
f'(x)=\mathstrut \amp \frac{d}{dx}\left[\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}\right]\\
=\mathstrut \amp \frac{\frac{d}{dx}[\sin(x)]\cos(x)-\sin(x)\frac{d}{dx}[\cos(x)]}{(\cos(x))^2}\\
=\mathstrut \amp \frac{(\cos(x))\cos(x)-\sin(x)(-\sin(x))}{(\cos(x))^2}\\
=\mathstrut \amp \frac{\cos(x)\cos(x)+\sin(x)\sin(x)}{\cos^2(x)}
\end{align*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-1243}{}\hypertarget{p-1873}{}%
The Pythagorean Identity states that \(\sin^2(\theta)+\cos^2(\theta)=1\) for any real number \(\theta\). We can rewrite the form of \(f'\) found in part (b) as%
\begin{equation*}
f'(x)=\frac{\cos^2(x)+\sin^2(x)}{\cos^2(x)}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and use the Pythagorean Identity to reduce the numerator to \(1\). Thus a simpler expression for \(f'(x)\) is%
\begin{equation*}
f'(x)=\frac{1}{\cos^2(x)}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-1244}{}\hypertarget{p-1874}{}%
Since \(\sec(x)=\frac{1}{\cos(x)}\), then%
\begin{equation*}
f'(x)=\frac{1}{\cos^2(x)}=\sec^2(x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-1245}{}\hypertarget{p-1875}{}%
Just like the original function \(f\), this derivative function \(f'\) can be expressed as a quotient, so its domain will be the values of \(x\) at which the numerator is defined and the denominator is nonzero. Since \(f'(x)=\frac{1}{\cos^2(x)}\), the numerator is always defined and the denominator is zero exactly when \(\cos(x)=0\), which occurs at odd integer multiples of \(\frac{\pi}2\). Thus the domain of \(f'\) consists of the values \(x\neq\frac{n\pi}{2}\), where \(n\) is an odd integer (positive or negative). This is the same as the domain of \(f\).%

\hypertarget{p-1876}{}%
In \hyperref[PA-2-4]{Example~\ref{PA-2-4}} we found that the derivative of the tangent function can be expressed in several ways, with its simplest form written in terms of the secant function. Next, we develop the derivative of the cotangent function.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1877}{}%
Let \(g(x) = \cot(x)\). To find \(g'(x)\), we observe that \(g(x) = \frac{\cos(x)}{\sin(x)}\) and apply the quotient rule. Hence%
\begin{align*}
g'(x) =\mathstrut \amp  \frac{(-\sin(x))\sin(x) - \cos(x) \cos(x)}{\sin^2(x)}\\
=\mathstrut \amp  -\frac{\sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x)}{\sin^2(x)}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1878}{}%
Applying the Pythagorean Identity, we see that \(g'(x) = -\frac{1}{\sin^2(x)}\). Now recall that \(\csc(x) = \frac{1}{\sin(x)}\); it follows that we can express \(g'\) by the rule%
\begin{equation*}
g'(x) = -\csc^2(x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1879}{}%
Note that neither \(g\) nor \(g'\) is defined when \(\sin(x) = 0\), which occurs at every integer multiple of \(\pi\). Hence we have the following rule.%

This makes sense because all trigonometric functions are periodic, and hence their derivatives will be periodic, too.%

When a mass hangs from a spring and is set in motion, the object's position oscillates in such a way that the size of the oscillations decreases. This is usually called a \emph{damped oscillation}. Suppose that for a particular object, its displacement from equilibrium (where the object sits at rest) is modeled by the function%
\begin{equation*}
s(t) = \frac{15 \sin(t)}{e^t}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Assume that \(s\) is measured in inches and \(t\) in seconds. Sketch a graph of this function for \(t \ge 0\) to see how it represents the situation described. Then compute \(\frac{ds}{dt}\), state the units of this function, and explain what it tells you about the object's motion. Finally, compute and interpret \(s'(2)\).%

The function \(\frac{ds}{dt} = s'(t)\) measures the instantaneous vertical velocity, in inches per second, of the mass that is attached to the spring. In particular, \(s'(2) = \frac{15\cos(2) - 15\sin(2)}{e^2} \approx -2.69\) inches per second.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-1306}{}\hypertarget{p-1965}{}%
The object's instantaneous velocity at \(t=2\) is given by \(h'(2)\). Since \(h(t) = 3 + \frac{2\cos(t)}{1.2^t}\), by the quotient rule we can determine that%
\begin{align*}
h'(t) &= \frac{1.2^t \cdot (-2\sin(t)) - 2\cos(t) \cdot 1.2^t \ln(1.2)}{(1.2^t)^2}\\
&= \frac{1.2^t (-2\sin(t) - 2\cos(t) \ln(1.2))}{(1.2^t)^2}\\
&= \frac{-2\sin(t) - 2\cos(t) \ln(1.2)}{1.2^t}\text{.}
\end{align*}
Thus, \(h'(2) = \frac{-2\sin(2) - 2\cos(2) \ln(1.2)}{1.2^2} \approx -1.1575\) feet per second is the instanateous (vertical) velocity of the object at \(t=2\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-1307}{}\hypertarget{p-1966}{}%
To find the object's acceleration at \(t=2\), we compute \(h''(2)\). First, by the quotient rule,%
\begin{align*}
h''(t) &= \frac{1.2^t(-2\cos(t) + 2\sin(t) \ln(1.2)) - (-2\sin(t) - 2\cos(t) \ln(1.2))1.2^t \ln(1.2)}{(1.2^t)^2}\\
&= \frac{-2\cos(t) + 2\sin(t) \ln(1.2)) + 2\sin(t)\ln(1.2) + 2\cos(t) \ln^2(1.2)}{1.2^t}\\
&= \frac{\cos(t)(-2 + 2\ln^2(1.2)) + 4\ln(1.2)\sin(t))}{1.2^t}\text{.}
\end{align*}
Therefore, the acceleration at \(t = 2\) is \(h''(2) = \frac{\cos(2)(-2 + 2\ln^2(1.2)) + 4\ln(1.2)\sin(2))}{1.2^2} \approx 1.0193\) feet per second per second.%
\item\hypertarget{li-1308}{}\hypertarget{p-1967}{}%
At \(t=2\), the object is falling and slowing down. We know the object is falling because its velocity is negative, and slowing down because its negative velocity is increasing (due to \(h''(2)\) being positive) and thus getting less negative.%

Since \(f(x) = \sin(x) \cot(x)\), by the product rule we know that \(f'(x) = \sin(x) \cdot (-\csc^2(x)) + \cot(x) \cdot \cos(x)\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-1316}{}\hypertarget{p-1978}{}%
False. Since \(\cot(x) = \frac{\cos(x)}{\sin(x)}\), we can write \(f(x) = \sin(x) \cdot \frac{\cos(x)}{\sin(x)}\). From here, it is tempting to ``cancel'' the \(\sin(x)\) term in the numerator and denominator. However, note that because of the \(\sin(x)\) in the denominator, \(f\) is not defined for \(x = \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi\) for any integer \(k\). In other words, the domain of \(f\) is all real numbers except odd multiples of \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). Thus, we can say that \(f(x) = \cos(x)\) for all real numbers except odd multiples of \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). But it is not the case that \(f(x) = \cos(x)\) for every value of \(x\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-1317}{}\hypertarget{p-1979}{}%
Taking our result from (a) and converting \(\csc(x)\) and \(\cot(x)\) to expressions involving the sine and cosine functions, we have%
\begin{align*}
f'(x) &= \sin(x) \cdot (-\csc^2(x)) + \cot(x) \cdot \cos(x)\\
&= \sin(x) \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{\sin^2(x)}\right) + \frac{\cos(x)}{\sin(x)} \cdot \cos(x)
\end{align*}
Provided that \(x \ne \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi\) for some integer value of \(k\), it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
f'(x) = -\frac{1}{\sin(x)} + \frac{\cos^2(x)}{\sin(x)} = \frac{\cos^2(x)-1}{\sin(x)}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
By the Pythagorean Identity, recall that \(\cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x) = 1\), and thus \(\cos^2(x)-1 = -\sin^2(x)\). Hence, for \(x \ne \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi\) for some integer value of \(k\), we have \(f'(x) = \frac{-\sin^2(x)}{\sin(x)} = -\sin(x)\). Again, this equality holds only for \(x \ne \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi\) for some integer value of \(k\) because those values of \(x\) are not in the domain of the original function \(f\).%

p'(x)=\mathstrut \amp g'(x)f(x)+g(x)f'(x)\\
=\mathstrut \amp (2x)(\sin(x))+(x^2)(\cos(x))\\
=\mathstrut \amp 2x\sin(x)+x^2\cos(x)\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par

Since \(q(x)=\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\), we will use the quotient rule to calculate \(q'(x)\). In doing so, we see that%
\begin{align*}
q'(x)=\mathstrut \amp \frac{f'(x)g(x)-f(x)g'(x)}{[g(x)]^2}\\
=\mathstrut \amp \frac{(\cos(x))(x^2)-(\sin(x))(2x)}{(x^2)^2}\\
=\mathstrut \amp \frac{x^2\cos(x)-2x\sin(x)}{x^4}\\
=\mathstrut \amp \frac{x\cos(x)-2\sin(x)}{x^3}\text{.}
\end{align*}

\hypertarget{p-2002}{}%
There is one more natural way to combine basic functions algebraically, and that is by \emph{composing} them. For instance, let's consider the function%
\begin{equation*}
C(x) = \sin(x^2)\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and observe that any input \(x\) passes through a \emph{chain} of functions. In the process that defines the function \(C(x)\), \(x\) is first squared, and then the sine of the result is taken. We can represent this using an arrow diagram \index{function!arrow diagram} as follows:%
\begin{equation*}
x \longrightarrow x^2 \longrightarrow \sin(x^2)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2003}{}%
It turns out we can express \(C\) in terms of the elementary functions \(f\) and \(g\) that were used above in \hyperref[chain-ex-1]{Example~\ref{chain-ex-1}}. Observe that \(x\) is the input for the function \(g\), and the result is then used as the input for \(f\). We write%
\begin{equation*}
C(x) = f(g(x)) = \sin(x^2)
\end{equation*}
and say that \(C\) is the \emph{composition} \index{composition} \index{function!composite function} of \(f\) and \(g\). We will refer to \(g\), the function that is first applied to \(x\), as the \emph{inner} function, while \(f\), the function that is applied to the result, as the \emph{outer} function.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2004}{}%
Given a composite function \(C(x) = f(g(x))\) that is built from differentiable functions \(f\) and \(g\), how do we compute \(C'(x)\) in terms of \(f\), \(g\), \(f'\), and \(g'\)? In the same way that the rate of change of a product of two functions, \(p(x) = f(x) \cdot g(x)\), depends on the behavior of both \(f\) and \(g\), it makes sense intuitively that the rate of change of a composite function \(C(x) = f(g(x))\) will also depend on some combination of \(f\) and \(g\) and their derivatives. The rule that describes how to compute \(C'\) in terms of \(f\) and \(g\) and their derivatives is called the \terminology{chain rule}.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2005}{}%
But before we can learn what the chain rule says and why it works, we first need to be comfortable decomposing composite functions so that we can correctly identify the inner and outer functions, as we did in the example above with \(C(x) = \sin(x^2)\).%

Often a composite function cannot be written in an alternate algebraic form. For instance, the function \(C(x) = \sin(x^2)\) cannot be expanded or otherwise rewritten, so it presents no alternate approaches to taking the derivative. But some composite functions can be expanded or simplified, and these provide a way to explore how the chain rule works. One example of this was the function \(r(x)=(\tan(x))^2\) in \hyperref[PA-2-5]{Example~\ref{PA-2-5}}; another example is investigated below in \hyperref[ex-2-5-linear]{Example~\ref{ex-2-5-linear}}.%
\begin{example}[]\label{ex-2-5-linear}
\hypertarget{p-2036}{}%
Let \(f(x) = -4x + 7\) and \(g(x) = 3x - 5\). Determine a formula for \(C(x) = f(g(x))\) and compute \(C'(x)\). How is \(C'\) related to \(f\) and \(g\) and their derivatives?%

By the rules given for \(f\) and \(g\),%
\begin{align*}
C(x) =\mathstrut \amp  f(g(x))\\
=\mathstrut \amp  f(3x-5)\\
=\mathstrut \amp  -4(3x-5) + 7\\

=\mathstrut \amp  -12x + 27\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2040}{}%
Thus, \(C'(x) = -12\). Noting that \(f'(x) = -4\) and \(g'(x) = 3\), we observe that \(C'\) appears to be the product of \(f'\) and \(g'\).%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-2041}{}%
It may seem that \hyperref[ex-2-5-linear]{Example~\ref{ex-2-5-linear}} is too elementary to illustrate how to differentiate a composite function. Linear functions are the simplest of all functions, and composing linear functions yields another linear function. While this example does not illustrate the full complexity of a composition of nonlinear functions, at the same time we remember that any differentiable function is \emph{locally} linear, and thus any function with a derivative behaves like a line when viewed up close. The fact that the derivatives of the linear functions \(f\) and \(g\) are multiplied to find the derivative of their composition turns out to be a key insight.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2042}{}%
We now consider a composition involving a nonlinear function.%
\begin{example}[]\label{ex-2-5-double-angle}
\hypertarget{p-2043}{}%

\(C'(x)=2\cos(2x)\).%

Using the double angle identity for the sine function, we write%
\begin{equation*}
C(x) = \sin(2x) = 2\sin(x)\cos(x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2047}{}%
Applying the product rule and simplifying, we find%
\begin{equation*}
C'(x) = 2\left((\cos(x))\cos(x) + \sin(x)(-\sin(x))\right) = 2(\cos^2(x) - \sin^2(x))\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2048}{}%
Next, we recall that the double angle identity for the cosine function states%
\begin{equation*}
\cos(2x) = \cos^2(x) - \sin^2(x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2049}{}%
Substituting this result into our expression for \(C'(x)\), we now have that%
\begin{equation*}
C'(x) = 2 \cos(2x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-2050}{}%
In \hyperref[ex-2-5-double-angle]{Example~\ref{ex-2-5-double-angle}}, if we let \(g(x) = 2x\) and \(f(x) = \sin(x)\), we observe that \(C(x) = f(g(x))\). Note that \(g'(x) = 2\) and \(f'(x) = \cos(x)\), so we can view the structure of \(C'(x)\) as%
\begin{equation*}
C'(x) = 2\cos(2x) = g'(x) f'(g(x))\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2051}{}%
In this example, as in the example involving linear functions, we see that the derivative of the composite function \(C(x) = f(g(x))\) is found by multiplying the derivatives of \(f\) and \(g\), but with \(f'\) evaluated at \(g(x)\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2052}{}%
Intuitively, it makes sense that these two quantities are involved in the rate of change of a composite function: if we ask how fast \(C\) is changing at a given \(x\) value, it clearly matters how fast \(g\) is changing at \(x\), as well as how fast \(f\) is changing at the value of \(g(x)\). It turns out that this structure holds for all differentiable functions\footnote{It is important to recognize that we have not proved the chain rule, instead we have given a reason you might believe the chain rule to be true.  A key component of mathematics is verifying one's intuition through formal proof.  We will omit the proof of the chain rule, but \textendash{} just like other differentiation rules \textendash{} the chain rule can be proved formally using the limit definition of the derivative.\label{fn-17}} as is stated in the chain rule.%

As with the product and quotient rules, it is often helpful to think verbally about what the chain rule says: ``If \(C\) is a composite function defined by an outer function \(f\) and an inner function \(g\), then \(C'\) is given by the derivative of the outer function evaluated at the inner function, times the derivative of the inner function.''%

The chain rule now joins the sum, constant multiple, product, and quotient rules in our collection of techniques for finding the derivative of a function through understanding its algebraic structure and the basic functions that constitute it. It takes practice to get comfortable applying multiple rules to differentiate a single function, but using proper notation and taking a few extra steps will help.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-107}

Find a formula for the derivative of \(h(t) = 3^{t^2 + 2t}\sec^4(t)\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2089}{}%
We first observe that \(h\) is the product of two functions: \(h(t) = a(t) \cdot b(t)\), where \(a(t) = 3^{t^2 + 2t}\) and \(b(t) = \sec^4(t)\). We will need to use the product rule to differentiate \(h\). And because \(a\) and \(b\) are composite functions, we will also need the chain rule. We therefore begin by computing \(a'(t)\) and \(b'(t)\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2090}{}%
Writing \(a(t) = f(g(t)) = 3^{t^2 + 2t}\) and finding the derivatives of \(f\) and \(g\) with respect to \(t\), we have%

Now we are finally ready to compute the derivative of the function \(h\). Recalling that \(h(t) = 3^{t^2 + 2t}\sec^4(t)\), by the product rule we have%
\begin{equation*}
h'(t) =  \frac{d}{dt}\left[3^{t^2 + 2t}\right]\sec^4(t)+3^{t^2 + 2t} \frac{d}{dt}\left[\sec^4(t)\right] \text{.}

From our work above with \(a\) and \(b\), we know the derivatives of \(3^{t^2 + 2t}\) and \(\sec^4(t)\). Therefore%

h'(t) = 3^{t^2 + 2t}\ln(3) (2t+2)\sec^4(t)  + 3^{t^2 + 2t} 4\sec^4(t) \tan(t) \text{.}

The above calculation may seem tedious.  However, by breaking the function down into small parts and calculating derivatives of those parts separately, we are able to accurately calculate the derivative of the entire function.%

\hypertarget{p-2139}{}%
As we gain more experience with differentiation, we will become more comfortable in simply writing down the derivative without taking multiple steps. This is particularly simple when the inner function is linear, since the derivative of a linear function is a constant.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-110}
\hypertarget{p-2140}{}%
Use the chain rule to differentiate each of the following composite functions whose inside function is linear:%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx} \left[ (5x+7)^{10} \right] = 10(5x+7)^9 \cdot 5\text{,}
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx} \left[ \tan(17x) \right] = 17\sec^2(17x), \ \text{and}
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx} \left[ e^{-3x} \right] = -3e^{-3x}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-2141}{}%
More generally, an excellent exercise for getting comfortable with the derivative rules is as follows. First write down a list of all the basic functions whose derivatives we know, and list the derivatives. Then write a composite function with the inner function being an unknown function \(u(x)\) and the outer function being a basic function. Finally, write the chain rule for the composite function. The following example illustrates this for two different functions.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-111}
\hypertarget{p-2142}{}%
To determine%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx}[\sin(u(x))]\text{,}
\end{equation*}
where \(u\) is a differentiable function of \(x\), we use the chain rule with the sine function as the outer function. Applying the chain rule, we find that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx}[\sin(u(x))] = \cos(u(x)) \cdot u'(x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
This rule is analogous to the basic derivative rule that \(\frac{d}{dx}[\sin(x)] = \cos(x)\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2143}{}%
Similarly, since \(\frac{d}{dx}[a^x] = a^x \ln(a)\) whenever \(a \gt 0\), it follows by the chain rule that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx}[a^{u(x)}] = a^{u(x)} \ln(a) \cdot u'(x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
This rule is analogous to the basic derivative rule that \(\frac{d}{dx}[a^{x}] = a^{x} \ln(a)\).%

Since \(h(x) = f(g(x))\), by the chain rule we know that \(h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)\). Using the facts that \(f(x)=x^3\) and \(g(x) = \sin(x)\), it follows \(f'(x) = 3x^2\) and \(f'(g(x)) = 3\sin^2(x)\), and \(g'(x) = \cos(x)\). Therefore,%
\begin{equation*}
h'(x) = 3\sin^2(x) \cdot \cos(x)

Note that \(r'(x) = g'(f(x)) \cdot f'(x) = \cos(x^3) \cdot 3x^2\).

We have observed in (a) and (b) that \(h'(x) = 3\sin^2(x) \cdot \cos(x)\) and \(r'(x) = \cos(x^3) \cdot 3x^2\). Because both parts of the product in \(h'(x)\) are periodic functions, \(h'(x)\) is periodic (with period \(2\pi\)). However, \(r'(x)\) is not periodic, since \(3x^2\) grows without bound as \(x\) increases.%

\frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{\pi}{3}\left( 12 \cdot 2 h(t) \cdot h'(t) - 3 (h(t))^2 \cdot h'(t) \right)

and hence using \(h(t) = \sin(\pi t) + 1\) and \(h'(t) = \pi \cos(\pi t)\),%
\begin{equation*}

The first calculation is a direct one, while the second is more indirect, as it involves the composition of \(V\) with \(h\) as a function of time. In the latter case, both \(h\) and \(V\) are functions of time, which allows us to think not only of how \(V\) is changing as a function of \(h\), but also as a function of \(t\).%

Much of mathematics centers on the notion of function. Indeed, throughout our study of calculus we are investigating the behavior of functions, with a particular emphasis on how fast the output of the function changes in response to changes in the input. Because each function represents a process, a natural question to ask is whether or not such a process can be reversed. That is, if we know the output that results from the function, can we (uniquely) determine the input that led to it? And if we know how fast a particular process is changing, can we determine how fast the inverse process is changing?%

One of the most important functions in all of mathematics is the natural exponential function \(f(x) = e^x\). Its inverse, the natural logarithm \(g(x) = \ln(x)\), is similarly important.

To solve the equation \(y=\frac59(x-32)\) for \(x\), we first multiply both sides by \(\frac95\) and then add \(32\):%
\begin{align*}
y=\mathstrut \amp \frac59(x-32)\\
\frac95y=\mathstrut \amp x-32 \\
\frac95y+32=\mathstrut \amp x\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-1474}{}\hypertarget{p-2233}{}%
From the initial equation \(y=\frac59(x-32)\) that relates a temperature of \(x\) degrees Fahrenheit to the equivalent temperature \(y\) degrees Celsius, we have said that \(C(x)=y\). Similarly, our work in part (a) rewrote that equation into the form \(x=\frac95y+32\) demonstrating the same relation between a temperature of \(x\) degrees Fahrenheit and \(y\) degrees Celsius. It should be the case, then, that \(F(y)=x\). Thus a formula for \(F\) is%
\begin{equation*}
F(y)=\frac95y+32\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-1475}{}\hypertarget{p-2234}{}%
In part (b), we said that \(C(x)=y\) and \(F(y)=x\). Based on this, it should be the case that%
\begin{equation*}
p(x)=F(C(x))=F(y)=x\text{,}
\end{equation*}
but we'll take a closer look to double check. Observe:%
\begin{align*}
p(x)=\mathstrut \amp F(C(x))\\
=\mathstrut \amp \frac95C(x)+32\\
=\mathstrut \amp \frac95\left(\frac59(x-32)\right)+32\\
=\mathstrut \amp (x-32)+32\\
=\mathstrut \amp x\text{.}
\end{align*}
To make sense of this, we notice that the function \(p\) takes a temperature \(x\), in degrees Fahrenheit, pushes it through the function \(C\) to convert it to \(C(x)\) degrees Celsius, and then pushes the result through the function \(F\) to convert it back into degrees Fahrenheit. Since \(F\) and \(C\) are each just converting the units of a given temperature, and the units of \(F(C(x))\) are the same as the units on \(x\), it is perfectly reasonable to end up with the equation \(x=F(C(x))\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-1476}{}\hypertarget{p-2235}{}%
The situation with \(r(y)=C(F(y))\) is analogous to that described in part (c). In part (b), we said that \(C(x)=y\) and \(F(y)=x\). Based on this, it should be the case that%
\begin{equation*}
r(y)=C(F(y))=C(x)=y\text{,}
\end{equation*}
but we'll take a closer look to double check. Observe:%
\begin{align*}
r(y)=\mathstrut \amp C(F(y))\\
=\mathstrut \amp \frac59(F(y)-32)\\
=\mathstrut \amp \frac59\left(\left(\frac95y+32\right)-32\right)\\
=\mathstrut \amp \frac59\left(\frac95y\right)\\
=\mathstrut \amp y\text{.}
\end{align*}
To make sense of this, we notice that the function \(r\) takes a temperature \(y\), in degrees Celsius, pushes it through the function \(F\) to convert it to \(F(y)\) degrees Fahrenheit, and then pushes the result through the function \(C\) to convert it back into degrees Celsius. Since \(F\) and \(C\) are each just converting the units of a given temperature, and the units of \(C(F(y))\) are the same as the units on \(y\), it is perfectly reasonable to end up with the equation \(y=C(F(y))\).%

A function \index{function!inverse function} \(f : A \to B\) is a rule that associates each element in the set \(A\) to one and only one element in the set \(B\). We call \(A\) the \terminology{domain} \index{domain} of \(f\) and \(B\) the \terminology{codomain} \index{codomain} of \(f\). If there exists a function \(g : B \to A\) such that \(g(f(a)) = a\) for every possible choice of \(a\) in the set \(A\) and \(f(g(b)) = b\) for every \(b\) in the set \(B\), then we say that \(g\) is the \terminology{inverse}  of \(f\).%
\end{assemblage}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2240}{}%
We often use the notation \(f^{-1}\) (read ``\("f\)-inverse"'') to denote the inverse of \(f\). The inverse function undoes the work of \(f\). Indeed, if \(y = f(x)\), then%
\begin{equation*}
f^{-1}(y) = f^{-1}(f(x)) = x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Thus, the equations \(y = f(x)\) and \(x = f^{-1}(y)\) say the same thing. The only difference between the two equations is \textemdash{} one is solved for \(x\), while the other is solved for \(y\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2241}{}%
Here we briefly remind ourselves of some key facts about inverse functions.%
\begin{note}[]\label{note-7}
\hypertarget{p-2242}{}%
For a function \(f : A \to B\), \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-2243}{}%
\(f\) has an inverse if and only if \(f\) is one-to-one\footnote{A function \(f\) is \terminology{one-to-one} \index{one-to-one} provided that no two distinct inputs lead to the same output.\label{fn-19}} and onto;\footnote{A function \(f\) is \terminology{onto} \index{onto} provided that every possible element of the codomain can be realized as an output of the function for some choice of input from the domain.\label{fn-20}}%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-2244}{}%
Provided \(f^{-1}\) exists, the domain of \(f^{-1}\) is the codomain of \(f\), and the codomain of \(f^{-1}\) is the domain of \(f\);%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-2245}{}%
\(f^{-1}(f(x)) = x\) for every \(x\) in the domain of \(f\) and \(f(f^{-1}(y)) = y\) for every \(y\) in the codomain of \(f\);%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-2246}{}%
\(y = f(x)\) if and only if \(x = f^{-1}(y)\).%
\end{itemize}
%
\end{note}
\hypertarget{p-2247}{}%
The last fact reveals a special relationship between the graphs of \(f\) and \(f^{-1}\). If a point \((x,y)\) lies on the graph of \(y = f(x)\), then it is also true that \(x = f^{-1}(y)\), which means that the point \((y,x)\) lies on the graph of \(f^{-1}\). This shows us that the graphs of \(f\) and \(f^{-1}\) are the reflections of each other across the line \(y = x\), because this reflection is precisely the geometric action that swaps the coordinates in an ordered pair. In \hyperref[F-2-6-Inverse-Plot]{Figure~\ref{F-2-6-Inverse-Plot}} below, we see this illustrated by the graphs of \(y=f(x)\) and \(y=f^{-1}(x)\), where \(f(x) = 2^x\). The marked points \(\big(-1,\frac{1}{2}\big)\) and \(\big(\frac{1}{2},-1\big)\) highlight the reflection of the curves across the line \(y = x\).%

To close our review of important facts about inverses, we recall that the natural exponential function \(f(x) = e^x\) has an inverse function, namely the natural logarithm \(f^{-1}(y) = \ln(y)\). Thus, writing \(y = e^x\) is interchangeable with \(x = \ln(y)\), while also \(\ln(e^x) = x\) for every real number \(x\), and \(e^{\ln(y)} = y\) for every positive real number \(y\).%

\subsection[{The Derivative of the Natural Logarithm Function}]{The Derivative of the Natural Logarithm Function}\label{subsection-67}
\hypertarget{p-2249}{}%
In what follows, we find a formula for the derivative of \(g(x) = \ln(x)\). To do so, we take advantage of the fact that we know the derivative of the natural exponential function, the inverse of \(g\). In particular, we know that writing \(g(x) = \ln(x)\) is equivalent to writing \(e^{g(x)} = x\). Now, we differentiate both sides of this equation and observe that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx}\left[e^{g(x)}\right] = \frac{d}{dx}[x]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2250}{}%
The righthand side is simply \(1\); by applying the chain rule to the left side, we find that%
\begin{equation*}
e^{g(x)} g'(x) = 1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2251}{}%
Next we solve for \(g'(x)\) and get%
\begin{equation*}
g'(x) = \frac{1}{e^{g(x)}}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2252}{}%
Finally, we recall that \(g(x) = \ln(x)\), so \(e^{g(x)} = e^{\ln(x)} = x\). Thus%
\begin{equation*}
g'(x) = \frac{1}{x}\text{.}
\end{equation*}

\hypertarget{p-2255}{}%
This rule for the natural logarithm function now joins our list of basic derivative rules. Note that this rule applies only to positive values of \(x\), as these are the only values for which \(\ln(x)\) is defined.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2256}{}%
Also notice that for the first time in our work, differentiating a basic function of a particular type has led to a function of a very different nature: the derivative of the natural logarithm is not another logarithm, nor even an exponential function, but rather a rational one.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2257}{}%
Derivatives of logarithms may now be computed in concert with all of the rules known to date. For instance, if \(f(t) = \ln(t^2 + 1)\), then by the chain rule, \(f'(t) = \frac{1}{t^2 + 1} \cdot 2t\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2258}{}%
There are interesting connections between the graphs of \(y=f(x)\) and \(y=f^{-1}(x)\), with \(f(x) = e^x\) and \(f^{-1}(x) = \ln(x)\).%

At the corresponding points \(A'\) and \(B'\) on the graph of the natural logarithm function (which come from reflecting \(A\) and \(B\) across the line \(y = x\)), we know that the slope of the tangent line is the reciprocal of the \(x\)-coordinate of the point (since \(\frac{d}{dx}[\ln(x)] = \frac{1}{x}\)). Thus, at \(A' = (0.5, \ln(0.5))\), we have \(m_{A'} = \frac{1}{0.5} = 2\), and at \(B' = (5, \ln(5))\), \(m_{B'} = \frac{1}{5}\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2261}{}%
In particular, we observe that \(m_{A'} = \frac{1}{m_A}\) and \(m_{B'} = \frac{1}{m_B}\). This is not a coincidence, but in fact holds for any curve \(y = f(x)\) and its inverse, provided the inverse exists. This is due to the reflection of the graphs across the line \(y = x\): the reflection changes the roles of \(x\) and \(y\), thus reversing the rise and run, so the slope of the inverse function at the reflected point is the reciprocal of the slope of the original function.%

Trigonometric functions are periodic, so they fail to be one-to-one, and thus do not have inverse functions. However, we can restrict the domain of each trigonometric function so that it is one-to-one on that domain.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2287}{}%
For instance, consider the sine function on the domain \([-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]\). Because no output of the sine function is repeated on this interval, the function is one-to-one and thus has an inverse. Thus, the function \(f(x) = \sin(x)\) with domain \(\big[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\big]\) and codomain \([-1,1]\) has an inverse function \(f^{-1}\) such that%
\begin{equation*}
f^{-1} : [-1,1] \to \left[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right]\text{.}

\hypertarget{p-2357}{}%
Earlier, we saw in \hyperref[F-2-6-Log-Exp]{Figure~\ref{F-2-6-Log-Exp}} an interesting relationship between the slopes of tangent lines to the natural exponential and natural logarithm functions at points reflected across the line \(y = x\). In particular, we observed that at the point \((\ln(2), 2)\) on the graph of \(f(x) = e^x\), the slope of the tangent line is \(f'(\ln(2)) = 2\), while at the corresponding point \((2, \ln(2))\) on the graph of \(f^{-1}(x) = \ln(x)\), the slope of the tangent line is \((f^{-1})'(2) = \frac{1}{2}\), which is the reciprocal of \(f'(\ln(2))\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2358}{}%
That the two corresponding tangent lines have reciprocal slopes is not a coincidence. If \(f\) and \(g\) are differentiable inverse functions, then \(y = f(x)\) if and only if \(x = g(y)\), and thus \(f(g(x)) = x\) for every \(x\) in the domain of \(f^{-1}\). Differentiating both sides of this equation, we have%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx} [f(g(x))] = \frac{d}{dx} [x]\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and by the chain rule,%
\begin{equation*}
f'(g(x)) g'(x) = 1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2359}{}%
Solving for \(g'(x)\), we have \(g'(x) = \frac{1}{f'(g(x))}\). Here we see that the slope of the tangent line to the inverse function \(g\) at the point \((x,g(x))\) is precisely the reciprocal of the slope of the tangent line to the original function \(f\) at the point \((g(x),f(g(x))) = (g(x),x)\).%
\begin{figure}

\caption{A graph of a function \(y = f(x)\) along with its inverse \(y = g(x) = f^{-1}(x)\).  Observe that the slopes of the two tangent lines are reciprocals of one another.\label{F-2-6-Gen-Inv}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-2360}{}%
To see this more clearly, consider the graph of the function \(y = f(x)\) shown above in \hyperref[F-2-6-Gen-Inv]{Figure~\ref{F-2-6-Gen-Inv}} along with its inverse \(y = g(x)\). Given a point \((a,b)\) that lies on the graph of \(f\), we know that \((b,a)\) lies on the graph of \(g\) because \(f(a) = b\) and \(g(b) = a\). Applying the rule that \(g'(x) = \frac{1}{f'(g(x))}\) to the value \(x = b\) yields the equation%
\begin{equation*}
g'(b) = \frac{1}{f'(g(b))} = \frac{1}{f'(a)}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
which is precisely what we see in the figure: the slope of the tangent line to \(g\) at \((b,a)\) is the reciprocal of the slope of the tangent line to \(f\) at \((a,b)\), since these two lines are reflections of one another across the line \(y = x\).  More generally, for any \(x\) in the domain of \(g'\), we have \(g'(x) = \frac{1}{f'(g(x))}\).%

\par
\hypertarget{p-2363}{}%
The rules we derived for \(\ln(x)\), \(\arcsin(x)\), and \(\arctan(x)\) are all just specific examples of this general property of the derivative of an inverse function. For example, with \(g(x) = \ln(x)\) and \(f(x) = e^x\), it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
g'(x) = \frac{1}{f'(g(x))} = \frac{1}{e^{\ln(x)}} = \frac{1}{x}\text{.}

\end{equation*}
and by the sum and constant multiple rules, it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
f'(x) = \frac{1}{2\arctan(x) + 3\arcsin(x) + 5} \cdot \left(\frac{2}{1+x^2} + \frac{3}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}\right)\text{.}

r'(z) = \frac{1}{1+\left(\ln(\arcsin(z))\right)^2} \cdot \frac{d}{dz} \left( \ln(\arcsin(z)) \right)\text{.}

Applying the chain rule again to evaluate \(\frac{d}{dz} \left( \ln(\arcsin(z)) \right)\),%
\begin{equation*}

\end{equation*}
Finally, using the basic rule for \(\frac{d}{dz}\left(\arcsin(z)\right)\),%
\begin{equation*}
r'(z) = \frac{1}{1+\left(\ln(\arcsin(z))\right)^2} \cdot \left( \frac{1}{\arcsin(z)} \right) \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z^2}}\text{.}

\end{equation*}
Next, we recall that \(\arcsin^4(7t) = \left(\arcsin(7t)\right)^4\) and \(\arctan^2(3t) = \left( \arctan(3t) \right)^2\), and apply the chain rule to find the derivative of each of these functions to get%
\begin{equation*}
q'(t) = \arctan^2(3t) \cdot \left[4\arcsin^3(7t) \frac{d}{dt}\left( \arcsin(7t) \right)\right] +  \arcsin^4(7t) \cdot \left[2\arctan(3t) \frac{d}{dt}\left(\arctan(3t)\right) \right] \text{.}
\end{equation*}
Finally, applying the chain rule one more time to evaluate the remaining derivatives,%
\begin{equation*}
q'(t) = \arctan^2(3t) \cdot \left[4\arcsin^3(7t) \left( \frac{7}{\sqrt{1+(7t)^2}} \right)\right] +  \arcsin^4(7t) \cdot \left[2\arctan(3t) \left(\frac{3}{1+(3t)^2}\right) \right]\text{.}

\end{equation*}
Thus, by the quotient rule,%
\begin{equation*}
g'(v) = \frac{1}{\frac{\arctan(v)}{\arcsin(v) + v^2}} \cdot \frac{(\arcsin(v) + v^2) \cdot \frac{1}{1+v^2} - \arctan(v) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2}} + 2v \right)}{(\arcsin(v) + v^2)^2}

One way to estimate the graph of \(y = f^{-1}(x)\) is to plot several \((x,y)\) points on the graph of \(y = f(x)\) and then plot the corresponding points \((y,x)\) with the coordinates reversed. Doing so and recalling that the graph of \(y = f^{-1}(x)\) is the reflection of the graph of \(y = f(x)\) across the line \(y = x\), we see the following figure.%

Because the original function passes through the point \((1,-1)\), the inverse function passes through \((-1,1)\). Moreover, since the tangent line to the original function at \((1,-1)\) has slope \(f'(1) \approx 2\), and the tangent line to the inverse function at \((-1,1)\) corresponds to the reflection of the original tangent line across the line \(y=x\), it follows that \(f'(-1) \approx 1/2\). This can also be deduced from the ``derivative of an inverse function'' rule, whereby \(f'(-1) = \frac{1}{f'(1)}\).%

To find a formula for \(g = f^{-1}\), we take the equation \(y = \frac{1}{4}x^3 + 4\) and solve for \(x\) in terms of \(y\). Doing so, we find that \(y - 4 = \frac{1}{4}x^3\), so \(x^3 = 4(y-4)\), and thus%
\begin{equation*}
x = \sqrt[3]{4(y-4)} = f^{-1}(y)\text{.}

\item\hypertarget{li-1582}{}\hypertarget{p-2408}{}%
First, \(f'(x) = \frac{3}{4}x^2\), and thus \(f'(2) = 3\).

What is special about these two derivative values is that they happen to be reciprocals. Noting that \(f(2) = 3\) and \(g(3) = 2\), we know that \(g'(3) = \frac{1}{f'(2)}\) by the rule for the derivative of an inverse function, and this matches our finding above that \(g'(3) = \frac{1}{3}\).%

What does it mean to say that a curve is an implicit function of \(x\), rather than an explicit function of \(x\)?%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-2422}{}%
How does implicit differentiation enable us to find a formula for \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) when \(y\) is an implicit function of \(x\)?%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-2423}{}%
In the context of an implicit curve, how can we use \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) to answer important questions about the tangent line to the curve?%
\end{itemize}
\end{objectives}
\hypertarget{p-2424}{}%
In all of our studies with derivatives so far, we have worked with functions whose formula is given explicitly in terms of \(x\). But there are many interesting curves whose equations involving \(x\) and \(y\) are impossible to solve for \(y\) in terms of \(x\).%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/2_7_Intro.pdf}
\caption{At left, the circle given by \(x^2 + y^2 = 16\).  In the middle, the portion of the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 16\) that has been highlighted in the box at left.  And at right, the lemniscate given by \(x^3 - y^3 = 6xy\).\label{F-2-7-Intro}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-2425}{}%
Perhaps the simplest and most natural of all such curves are circles. Because of the circle's symmetry, for each \(x\)-value that is strictly between the endpoints of the horizontal diameter, there are two corresponding \(y\)-values. For instance, on the left side of \hyperref[F-2-7-Intro]{Figure~\ref{F-2-7-Intro}} above, we have labeled \(A = (-3,\sqrt{7})\) and \(B = (-3,-\sqrt{7})\). These points demonstrate that the circle fails the vertical line test and indicate that it is impossible to represent the circle through a single function of the form \(y = f(x)\). However, portions of the circle, such as the highlighted arc that is magnified in the center of \hyperref[F-2-7-Intro]{Figure~\ref{F-2-7-Intro}}, \emph{can} be represented explicitly as a function of \(x\). Moreover, it is evident that the circle is locally linear, so we ought to be able to find a tangent line to the curve at every point. Thus, it makes sense to wonder if we can compute \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) at any point on the circle, even though we cannot write \(y\) explicitly as a function of \(x\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2426}{}%
We say that the equation \(x^2 + y^2 = 16\) defines \(y\) \emph{implicitly} as a function of \(x\). The graph of the equation can be broken into pieces where each piece can be defined by an explicit function of \(x\). For the circle, we could choose to take the top half as one function of \(x\), namely \(y = \sqrt{16 - x^2}\), and the bottom half as \(y = -\sqrt{16 - x^2}\). The equation for the circle defines two \terminology{implicit functions} of \(x\). \index{implicit function} \index{function!implicit function}%

\frac{d}{dx}\left[xf(x)+f(cx)+cf(x)\right]=\frac{d}{dx}\left[xf(x)\right]+\frac{d}{dx}\left[f(cx)\right]+\frac{d}{dx}\left[cf(x)\right]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
We now apply the product rule to the first term, the chain rule to the middle term, and the constant multiple rule to the final term. This gives us%
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dx}\left[xf(x)+f(cx)+cf(x)\right]=\mathstrut \amp [f(x)+xf'(x)]+[cf'(cx)]+c[f'(x)]\\
=\mathstrut \amp f(x)+xf'(x)+cf'(cx)+cf'(x)\text{.}
\end{align*}

\hypertarget{p-2450}{}%
We begin our exploration of implicit differentiation with the example of the circle described by \(x^2 + y^2 = 16\). How can we find a formula for \(\frac{dy}{dx}\)?%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2451}{}%
By viewing \(y\) as an \emph{implicit} function of \(x\), we think of \(y\) as some function whose formula \(f(x)\) is unknown, but which we can differentiate. Just as \(y\) represents an unknown formula, so too its derivative with respect to \(x\), \(\frac{dy}{dx}\), will be (at least temporarily) unknown.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2452}{}%
So we view \(y\) as an unknown differentiable function of \(x\) and differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to \(x\).%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx} \left[ x^2 + y^2 \right] = \frac{d}{dx} \left[ 16 \right]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2453}{}%
On the right, the derivative of the constant \(16\) is \(0\), and on the left we can apply the sum rule, so it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx} \left[ x^2 \right]  + \frac{d}{dx} \left[ y^2 \right] = 0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2454}{}%
Note carefully the different roles being played by \(x\) and \(y\). Because \(x\) is the independent variable, \(\frac{d}{dx} \left[x^2\right] = 2x\). But \(y\) is the dependent variable and \(y\) is an implicit function of \(x\). Recall \hyperref[PA-2-7]{Example~\ref{PA-2-7}}, where we computed \(\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)^2]\). Computing \(\frac{d}{dx}[y^2]\) is the same and requires the chain rule, by which we find that \(\frac{d}{dx}[y^2] = 2y^1 \frac{dy}{dx}\). We now have that%
\begin{equation*}
2x + 2y \frac{dy}{dx} = 0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2455}{}%
We solve this equation for \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) by subtracting \(2x\) from both sides and dividing by \(2y\).%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{2x}{2y} = -\frac{x}{y}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2456}{}%
There are several important things to observe about the result that \(\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{x}{y}\). First, this expression for the derivative involves both \(x\) and \(y\). This makes sense because there are two corresponding points on the circle for each value of \(x\) between \(-4\) and \(4\), and the slope of the tangent line is different at each of these points.%

\hypertarget{p-2458}{}%
For the curve given implicitly by \(x^3 + y^2 - 2xy = 2\), shown below in \hyperref[F-2-7-Ex1]{Figure~\ref{F-2-7-Ex1}}, find the slope of the tangent line at \((-1,1)\).%

\caption{The curve \(x^3 + y^2 - 2xy = 2\).\label{F-2-7-Ex1}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-2459}{}%
We begin by differentiating the curve's equation implicitly. Taking the derivative of each side with respect to \(x\) yields%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx}\left[ x^3 + y^2 - 2xy \right] = \frac{d}{dx} \left[ 2 \right]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
By the sum rule and the fact that the derivative of a constant is zero, we have%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx}[x^3] + \frac{d}{dx}[y^2] - 2\frac{d}{dx}[xy] = 0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2460}{}%
For the three derivatives we now must execute, the first uses the simple power rule, the second requires the chain rule (since \(y\) is an implicit function of \(x\)), and the third necessitates the product rule (again, since \(y\) is a function of \(x\)). Applying these rules, we now find that%
\begin{equation*}
3x^2 + 2y\frac{dy}{dx} - 2[y+x\frac{dy}{dx}] = 0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2461}{}%
We want to solve this equation for \(\frac{dy}{dx}\). To do so, we first collect all of the terms involving \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) on one side of the equation.%
\begin{equation*}
2y\frac{dy}{dx} - 2x \frac{dy}{dx}= 2y - 3x^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2462}{}%
Then we factor the left side to isolate \(\frac{dy}{dx}\).%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dx}(2y - 2x) = 2y - 3x^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2463}{}%
Finally, we divide both sides by \((2y - 2x)\) and conclude that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{2y-3x^2}{2y-2x}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2464}{}%
Note that the expression for \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) depends on both \(x\) and \(y\). To find the slope of the tangent line at \((-1,1)\), we substitute the coordinates into the formula for \(\frac{dy}{dx}\), using the notation%
\begin{equation*}
\left. \frac{dy}{dx} \right|_{(-1,1)} = \frac{2(1)-3(-1)^2}{2(1)-2(-1)} = -\frac14\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2465}{}%
This value matches our visual estimate of the slope of the tangent line shown in \hyperref[F-2-7-Ex1]{Figure~\ref{F-2-7-Ex1}}.%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-2466}{}%
\hyperref[Ex-2-7-1]{Example~\ref{Ex-2-7-1}} shows that it is possible when differentiating implicitly to have multiple terms involving \(\frac{dy}{dx}\). We use addition and subtraction to collect all terms involving \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) on one side of the equation, then factor to get a single term of \(\frac{dy}{dx}\). Finally, we divide to solve for \(\frac{dy}{dx}\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2467}{}%
We use the notation%
\begin{equation*}
\left. \frac{dy}{dx} \right|_{(a,b)}
\end{equation*}
to denote the evaluation of \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) at the point \((a,b)\). This is analogous to writing \(f'(a)\) when \(f'\) depends on a single variable.%
\begin{warning}[]\label{warning-2}
\hypertarget{p-2468}{}%
There is a big difference between writing \(\frac{d}{dx}\) and \(\frac{dy}{dx}\). For example,%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx}[x^2 + y^2]
\end{equation*}
gives an instruction to take the derivative with respect to \(x\) of the quantity \(x^2 + y^2\), presumably where \(y\) is a function of \(x\). On the other hand,%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dx}(x^2 + y^2)
\end{equation*}
means the product of the derivative of \(y\) with respect to \(x\) with the quantity \(x^2 + y^2\). Understanding this notational subtlety is absolutely necessary.%

Because the graph of the curve fails the vertical line test, \(y\) cannot be a function of \(x\). This also confirms our intuition that there is not an algebraic means by which we can rearrange the equation \(x = y^5 - 5y^3 + 4y\) to write \(y\) in terms of \(x\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-1628}{}\hypertarget{p-2487}{}%
We differentiate implicitly, taking the derivative of each side with respect to \(x\):%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx}[x ]= \frac{d}{dx}[y^5 - 5y^3 + 4y]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
We then evaluate the elementary derivative on the left and use the sum rule on the right to find that%
\begin{equation*}
1 = \frac{d}{dx}[y^5] - \frac{d}{dx}[5y^3] + \frac{d}{dx}[4y]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Viewing \(y\) as a function of \(x\) and using the chain and constant multiple rules, we now have%
\begin{equation*}
1 = 5y^4\frac{dy}{dx} - 15y^2\frac{dy}{dx} + 4\frac{dy}{dx}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Factoring yields%
\begin{equation*}
1 = \frac{dy}{dx}\big(5y^4 - 15y^2 + 4\big)\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and therefore%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{5y^4 - 15y^2 + 4}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-1629}{}\hypertarget{p-2488}{}%
To find an equation of the line tangent to the graph of \(x = y^5 - 5y^3 + 4y\) at the point \((0, 1)\), we only need the slope of the tangent line. Hence we compute%
\begin{equation*}
\left. \frac{dy}{dx} \right|_{(0,1)} = \frac{1}{5(1)^4 - 15(1)^2 + 4} = -\frac{1}{6}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Therefore, the equation of the tangent line is%
\begin{equation*}
y - 1 = -\frac{1}{6}(x-0),
\end{equation*}
or \(y = -\frac{1}{6}x + 1\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-1630}{}\hypertarget{p-2489}{}%
Since a line is vertical whenever its slope is undefined, we seek all points \((x,y)\) that make \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) undefined. This will occur precisely when the denominator, \(5y^4 - 15y^2 + 4\), is zero. Using a graphing utility or computer algebra system to solve the equation \(5y^4 - 15y^2 + 4 = 0\), we find that this happens at the four approximate \(y\)-values \(y \approx \pm 0.543912, \pm 1.64443\). For each such value, we use the original equation \(x = y^5 - 5y^3 + 4y\) to find the \(x\)-value of the point. Doing so, we have established that there are four points at which the tangent line is vertical, and they are approximately \((1.418697,0.543912)\), \((-1.418697,-0.543912)\), \((-3.63143, 1.64443)\), and \((3.63143, -1.64443)\).%
\end{enumerate}
%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-2490}{}%
It is natural to ask where the tangent line to a curve is vertical or horizontal. The slope of a horizontal tangent line must be zero, while the slope of a vertical tangent line is undefined. Often the formula for \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) is expressed as a quotient of functions of \(x\) and \(y\), say%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{p(x,y)}{q(x,y)}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2491}{}%
The tangent line is horizontal precisely when the numerator is zero and the denominator is nonzero, making the slope of the tangent line zero. If we can solve the equation \(p(x,y) = 0\) for either \(x\) and \(y\) in terms of the other, we can substitute that expression into the original equation for the curve. This gives an equation in a single variable, and if we can solve that equation we can find the point(s) on the curve where \(p(x,y) = 0\). At those points, the tangent line is horizontal.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2492}{}%
Similarly, the tangent line is vertical whenever \(q(x,y) = 0\) and \(p(x,y) \ne 0\), making the slope undefined.%
\begin{example}[]\label{act-2-7-2}
\hypertarget{p-2493}{}%

\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{(x-1)(x-2) + x(x-2) + x(x-1)}{(y^2-1)(y-2) + 2y^2(y-2) + y(y^2-1)}\text{.}

Expanding and combining like terms, we find that \(3x^2 - 6x + 2 = 0\), which occurs where%
\begin{equation*}
x = \frac{6\pm\sqrt{(-6)^2-4(3)(2)}}{2(3)}=\frac{3\pm\sqrt{3}}{3}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Since \(\frac{3+\sqrt3}3\approx 1.57735\) and \(\frac{3-\sqrt3}3\approx 0.42265\), we see from the graph in \hyperref[F-2-7-Act2]{Figure~\ref{F-2-7-Act2}} that at each such \(x\)-value, there are four corresponding \(y\)-values\footnote{For instance, when \(x =\frac{3-\sqrt3}3\), then \(y\) must satisfy the equation \(y(y^2-1)(y-2) = x(x-1)(x-2)|_{x=\frac{3-\sqrt3}3} = \frac{2\sqrt3}9\). Because this is a quartic (degree 4) equation in \(y\), we can use computational technology to help us find the solutions. Doing so, we find four approximate values for \(y\): \(y \approx -1.058, 0.229, 0.771, 2.058\). Thus our estimates for four points at which the tangent line is horizontal are: \(\left(\frac{3-\sqrt3}3, -1.058\right)\), \(\left(\frac{3-\sqrt3}3, 0.229\right)\), \(\left(\frac{3-\sqrt3}3, 0.771\right)\), and \(\left(\frac{3-\sqrt3}3, 2.058\right)\). Similar work can be done to find the four points at which the tangent line is horizontal when \(x=\frac{3+\sqrt3}3\).\label{fn-22}} for which the tangent line will be horizontal.%

The tangent line to the curve is vertical wherever \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) is undefined, which occurs precisely where%
\begin{equation*}
(y^2-1)(y-2) + 2y^2(y-2) + y(y^2-1) = 0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Expanding and combining like terms, we see that we need to solve the cubic equation \(4y^3 - 6y^2 - 2y + 2 = 0\). From the graph, it appears that \(y=\frac12\) is a point at which the tangent line is vertical, and we verify this by plugging it into our cubic equation. The equation then factors as \(2(2y-1)(y^2-y-1)=0\), with the quadratic term having roots \(y=\frac{1\pm\sqrt5}2\). Visual inspection of the curve at \(y=\frac12\), \(y\approx -1.236\), and \(y\approx -0.618\) reveals that each of these \(y\)-values occurs at exactly one point of vertical tangency.\footnote{We may wish to find the \(x\)-coordinate that corresponds to each such \(y\)-value. For instance, when \(y = \frac{1}{2}\), \(x\) must satisfy \(\frac{1}{2}\big(\frac{1}{4}-1\big)\big(\frac{1}{2}-2\big) = x(x-1)(x-2)\), or in other words, \(x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x = \frac{9}{16}\). We can use technology to verify that there is only one such \(x\), and \(x \approx 2.210\). Similar work can be done to find the \(x\)-values that correspond to \(y = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}\).\label{fn-23}}%
\item\hypertarget{li-1642}{}\hypertarget{p-2509}{}%
There are four points on the curve where \(x = 1\), which correspond to the \(y\)-values that satisfy \(y(y^2-1)(y-2) = 0\): \((1,0)\), \((1,1)\), \((1,-1)\), \((1,2)\). We choose the point \((1,1)\) and evaluate \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) at this point. Doing so,%
\begin{equation*}
\left.\frac{dy}{dx} \right|_{(1,1)} = \frac{(1-1)(1-2) + 1(1-2) + 1(1-1)}{(1^2-1)(1-2) + 2\cdot 1^2(1-2) + 1(1^2-1)} = \frac{-1}{-2} = \frac{1}{2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}

Differentiating with respect to \(x\),%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx}[x^3 - y^3] = \frac{d}{dx}[6xy]\text{,}
\end{equation*}
so that by the chain and product rules we have%
\begin{equation*}
3x^2 - 3y^2 \frac{dy}{dx} = 6y+6x\frac{dy}{dx}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Rearranging to get all terms with \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) on the same side, it follows that%
\begin{align*}
3x^2-6y = \mathstrut \amp 3y^2\frac{dy}{dx}+6x\frac{dy}{dx}\\
= \mathstrut \amp (3y^2+6x)\frac{dy}{dx}\text{.}
\end{align*}
Thus we have established that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{3x^2-6y}{3y^2 + 6x}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Evaluating at the point \((-3,3)\), we have \(\left. \frac{dy}{dx} \right|_{(-3,3)} = \frac{3(-3)^2-6(3)}{3(3)^2 + 6(-3)} = 1\). Thus the tangent line has equation \(y - 3 = 1(x+3)\), or \(y=x+6\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-1656}{}\hypertarget{p-2525}{}%
After differentiating with respect to \(x\), we have%
\begin{equation*}
\cos(y) \frac{dy}{dx} + \frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2 + 1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Taking the usual steps to solve for \(\frac{dy}{dx}\), we find that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{3x^2 + 1}{\cos(y) + 1}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Evaluating the slope of the tangent line at \((0,0)\), we have \(\left. \frac{dy}{dx} \right|_{(0,0)} = \frac{1}{2}\), and thus the tangent line at \((0,0)\) has equation \(y = \frac{1}{2}x\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-1657}{}\hypertarget{p-2526}{}%
Differentiating both sides with respect to \(x\) yields%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx}\left[3xe^{-xy}\right]=\frac{d}{dx}\left[y^2\right]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
On the left side, we need to start with the product rule; the right side requires the chain rule because \(y\) is a function of \(x\). Applying these rules gives us%
\begin{equation*}
3e^{-xy}+3x\frac{d}{dx}\left[e^{-xy}\right]=2y\frac{dy}{dx}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
To continue differentiating the left side, we need the chain rule followed by the product rule:%
\begin{align*}
3e^{-xy}+3x\frac{d}{dx}\left[e^{-xy}\right]=\mathstrut \amp 3e^{-xy}+3x\left(e^{-xy}\frac{d}{dx}\left[-xy\right]\right)\\
=\mathstrut \amp 3e^{-xy}+3xe^{-xy}\left(-y-x\frac{dy}{dx}\right)\\
=\mathstrut \amp 3e^{-xy}-3xye^{-xy}-3x^2e^{-xy}\frac{dy}{dx}\text{.}
\end{align*}
We now have the equation%
\begin{equation*}
3e^{-xy}-3xye^{-xy}-3x^2e^{-xy}\frac{dy}{dx}=2y\frac{dy}{dx}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Since we need to solve for \(\frac{dy}{dx}\), we combine like terms before factoring and dividing to end up with%
\begin{align*}
3e^{-xy}-3xye^{-xy}=\mathstrut \amp 2y\frac{dy}{dx}+3x^2e^{-xy}\frac{dy}{dx}\\
=\mathstrut \amp \left(2y+3x^2e^{-xy}\right)\frac{dy}{dx}\\
\mathstrut \amp \\
\frac{3e^{-xy}-3xye^{-xy}}{2y+3x^2e^{-xy}}=\mathstrut \amp\frac{dy}{dx}\text{.}
\end{align*}
Evaluating at the point \((0.619,1)\), we find the slope of the tangent line to be%
\begin{equation*}
\left.\frac{dy}{dx}\right|_{(0.619,1)}=\frac{3e^{-0.619}-3(0.619)e^{-0.619}}{2+3(0.619)^2e^{-0.619}}\approx0.235\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Hence the tangent line equation is \(y-1=0.235(x-0.619)\).%
\end{enumerate}
%

\hypertarget{p-2527}{}%
Implicit differentiation also gives us tools that we can use to find the derivative of functions that are given explicitly. The following example demonstrates the technique for one such function.%

\hypertarget{p-2528}{}%
Find \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) when \(y=x^x\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2529}{}%
We first notice that our previous rules of differentiation do not apply in this case because we have a variable in both the base and the exponent of this expression. In order to solve this problem, we will need to turn it into an equivalent implicit function. We begin by taking the natural logarithm of both sides to get%
\begin{equation*}
\ln(y)=\ln(x^x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Through the properties of logarithms, this simplifies to%
\begin{equation*}
\ln(y)=x\ln(x).
\end{equation*}
Now we can implicitly differentiate both sides, yielding%
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{y}\frac{dy}{dx} = \mathstrut \amp \ln(x)+x\frac1x\\
=\mathstrut \amp \ln(x)+1\text{.}
\end{align*}
Simplification by collecting and isolating \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) gives us%
\begin{align*}
\frac{dy}{dx} = \mathstrut \amp y(\ln(x)+1)\\
=\mathstrut \amp x^x(\ln(x)+1)\text{.}
\end{align*}
Therefore,%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx}[x^x]=x^x(\ln(x)+1).

\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-137}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-2536}{}%
First, we compute \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) by implicit differentiation. Differentiating both sides of the given equation with respect to \(x\) while treating \(y\) as a function of \(x\), we see that%
\begin{equation*}
6y^2 \frac{dy}{dx} + 2y \frac{dy}{dx} - 5y^4 \frac{dy}{dx} = 4x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Removing a factor of \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) from the lefthand side and dividing to solve for \(\frac{dy}{dx}\), we have%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{4x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x}{6y^2 + 2y - 5y^4} = \frac{2x(2x^2 - 3x + 1)}{y(-5y^3 + 6y + 2)}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
The tangent line is potentially horizontal where the numerator of \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) is zero and potentially vertical where \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) is zero. Solving \(2x(2x^2 - 3x + 1) = 0\), we see that%
\begin{equation*}
2x(2x-1)(x-1) = 0
\end{equation*}
so the numerator is zero at \(x = 0, 0.5, 1\). The denominator is zero where \(y(-5y^3 + 6y + 2) = 0\). Using technology to estimate where \(-5y^3 + 6y + 2 = 0\), we see the denominator is zero at \(y = 0\) and \(y \approx -0.856, -0.379, 1.235\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2537}{}%
Next, we need to find the coordinates of these points where potential horizontal or vertical tangent lines occur. First, we consider the potential horizontal tangent line locations. When \(x = 0\), \(2y^3+y^2-y^5 = x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2 = 0\), and thus we know \(y^2(2y + 1 - y^3) = 0\), from which it follows that \(y = 0\), \(y=-1\) or \(y \approx -0.618, 1.618\). This leads to four points to consider: \((0,0)\), \((0,-1)\), \((0,-0.618)\), and \((0,1.618)\). It is apparent from the graph shown below that the tangent line at \((0,0)\) is not horizontal (here both the numerator and denominator of \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) are zero), but at each of the other three points, the tangent line is horizontal.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2538}{}%
We now reason similarly for the other \(x\)-values where the numerator is zero. At \(x = 1\), \(2y^3+y^2-y^5 = 1^4 - 2\cdot 1^3 + 1^2 = 0\), and here again \(y = 0\), \(y=-1\) or \(y \approx -0.618, 1.618\). This leads to four potential points where the tangent line is horizontal: \((1,0)\), \((1,-1)\), \((1,-0.618)\), and \((1,1.618)\). At \((1,0)\), there's not a horizontal tangent line, but at each of the others there is, as seen in the figure. Similar reasoning when \(x = 0.5\) shows that \(2y^3+y^2-y^5 = 0.5^4 - 2\cdot 0.5^3 + 0.5^2 = 0.625\), from which we find that \(y \approx -1.0493, 0.2104, 1.6139\), and thus the three points \((0.5,-1.0493)\), \((0.5,0.2104)\), \((0.5, 1.6139)\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2539}{}%
Returning to where the denominator is zero (\(y = 0\) and \(y \approx -0.856, -0.379, 1.235\)), we now determine points where the tangent line is vertical. Is is apparent from the figure below that there are no vertical tangent lines when \(y = 0\) or \(y \approx -0.856\), so there are two values to pursue: \(y \approx -0.379, 1.235\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2540}{}%
When \(y \approx -0.379\), it follows that \(2(-0.379)^3+(-0.379)^2-(-0.379)^5 = x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2\), so%
\begin{equation*}
x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2 = 0.0426
\end{equation*}
from which we find that \(x \approx -0.1756, 0.2912, 0.7088, 1.1756\). The figure confirms that there are vertical tangent lines at \((-0.1756,-0.379)\), \((0.2912,-0.379)\), \((0.7088,-0.379)\), and \((1.1756,-0.379)\)%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2541}{}%
Lastly, when \(y \approx 1.235\), it follows \(2(1.235)^3+(1.235)^2-(1.235)^5 = x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2\), so%
\begin{equation*}
x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2 = 2.4195
\end{equation*}
and thus via technology, \(x \approx -0.8437, 1.8437\). This leads to two additional points at which the tangent line is vertical: \((-0.8437, 1.235)\) and \((1.8437, 1.235)\).%

First we need to find the slope of the line tangent to the curve, or \(\frac{dy}{dx}\). To do so, we differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to \(x\), treating \(y\) as a function of \(x\) to obtain%
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dx} \left( \sin(x+y) + \cos(x-y) \right) &= \frac{d}{dx}(1)\\
\cos(x+y) \left(1+\frac{dy}{dx}\right) - \sin(x-y)\left(1-\frac{dy}{dx}\right) &= 0\text{.}
\end{align*}
Distributing on the left side of the equation,%
\begin{equation*}
\cos(x+y) + \cos(x+y)\frac{dy}{dx} - \sin(x-y) + \sin(x-y)\frac{dy}{dx} = 0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Removing a factor of \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) from two terms on the right and moving the other two terms to the righthand side,%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dx} \left(\cos(x+y) + \sin(x-y) \right) =  \sin(x-y) - \cos(x+y)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Therefore,%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\sin(x-y) - \cos(x+y)}{\cos(x+y) + \sin(x-y)}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
At the point \(\left(\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)\) we have that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dx}\biggm|_{\left(\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)} = \frac{\sin(0)-\cos(\pi)}{\cos(\pi) + \sin(0)} = -1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Therefore, the equation of the line tangent to the curve at the point \(\left(\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)\) is \(y = \frac{\pi}{2} - \left(x-\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\). A portion of the graph of the curve defined by \(\sin(x+y) + \cos(x-y) = 1\) and the tangent line to the curve at the point \(\left(\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)\) are shown in the following figure.%

Taking the natural log of both sides, \(\ln(y) = \ln(a^x) = x \ln(a)\). Thus, it follows that%

There is an important class of functions that show up in many real-life situations: the so-called \terminology{hyperbolic functions}. Hyperbolic functions can be used to describe the shape of electrical lines freely hanging between two poles or any idealized hanging chain or cable supported only at its ends and hanging under its own weight. Hyperbolic functions can also be used to describe the path of a spacecraft performing a ``gravitational slingshot'' maneuver.%

A cable hanging between two supports will form the shape of a hyperbolic cosine. In particular, the formula%
\begin{equation*}
y = \frac{T}{w}\cosh\left(\frac{wx}{T}\right),
\end{equation*}
where \(T\) is the tension at its lowest point and \(w\) is the weight of the cable per unit length, will yield the total cable sag when evaluated at \(x=0\). We can calculate the total sag in a powerline hanging between two poles spaced 400 feet apart where the mass per unit length is \(50\) lb/ft and the tension at the lowest point is \(2025\) lbs.  Specifically, the total sag is given by%
\begin{equation*}
y = \frac{2025 \mbox{ lb}}{50 \mbox{ lb/ft}}\cosh\left(\frac{50\times 0}{2025}\right)=40.5 \mbox{ ft}.

Similar to the usual trigonometric functions, the hyperbolic trigonometric functions have several important properties. While we will not take the time to directly show these properties are valid, we do encourage the reader to confirm these properties by using the formulas and by inspecting the graphs in \hyperref[hyperbolic-images]{Figure~\ref{hyperbolic-images}} above.%

It is also useful to discuss the long-run behavior of the hyperbolic trigonometric functions. Again, inspection of \hyperref[hyperbolic-images]{Figure~\ref{hyperbolic-images}} above suggests that as \(x\rightarrow\infty\), the graph of \(\cosh(x)\) resembles the graph of \(\frac12e^x\). Similarly, it appears that as \(x\rightarrow-\infty\), the graph of \(\cosh(x)\) resembles the graph of \(\frac12e^{-x}\).  This behavior is further explained by using the formulas for \(\cosh(x)\) and \(\sinh(x)\) and the facts that \(e^{-x}\rightarrow0\) as \(x\rightarrow\infty\), and \(e^{x}\rightarrow0\) as \(x\rightarrow-\infty\).%

Recall that the trig functions were defined on the unit circle, giving us the Pythagorean identity: if we set \(x = \cos(\theta)\) and \(y=\sin(\theta)\), then the point \((x,y)\) lies on the unit circle, and we have%
\begin{equation*}
\cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta) = 1\text{ because }x^2+y^2 = 1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
In fact, an analogous identity holds for the hyperbolic trigonometric functions. \hypertarget{p-2574}{}%

 This identity shows us how the hyperbolic functions got their name.  Suppose \((x,y)\) is a point in the plane, and \(x = \cosh\theta\) and \(y=\sinh\theta\) for some \(\theta\).  Then the point \((x,y)\) lies on the hyperbola \(x^2-y^2 = 1\).%

A company wishes to build a suspension bridge that stretches between the basketball arena and the baseball stadium on the other side of the railway lines in a particular city.  The center part of the bridge will be suspended between two concrete pillars 280 feet apart and 80 feet high. The cable holding the bridge is to be exactly 30 feet above the railway tracks in the middle of the bridge, i.e. it sags exactly 50 feet.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2584}{}%
In 1691, Gottfried Leibniz and Christian Huygens determined that any cable hanging under the force of gravity must have the shape of the graph of%
\begin{equation*}
y(x) = a \cosh\left( \frac x a \right) + b. 
\end{equation*}
This shape is known as a \emph{catenary}. \index{catenary} The parameter \(a\) is the ratio of cable tension to cable density.  The only use of the parameter \(b\) is to provide a vertical shift, if needed.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2585}{}%
We can ask two important questions.  First, what values must \(a\) and \(b\) have in order for the catenary to fit the constraints provided by the placement of the concrete pillars and the low point of the cable?%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2586}{}%
In order to find \(a\) and \(b\) we need to solve two separate equations.  We know that \(y(0)=30\) to ensure we have sufficient clearance above the railway tracks. We also know that \(y(140)=80\) since the cable attaches to a 80 foot tall pillar 140 feet from the lowest point (center).  Therefore we have%
\begin{equation*}
30=a \cosh\left( \frac 0 a \right) + b\text{,}
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
80=a \cosh\left( \frac{140}{a} \right) + b\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Since \(\cosh(0)=1\) we can simplify the first equation to \(30=a+b\). Substituting this equation into the second equation yields \(80=a \cosh\left( \frac{140}{a} \right) +30-a\). Now, by graphing the function \(y=x \cosh\left( \frac{140}{x} \right) +30-x\) and the line \(y=80\) and then graphically searching for the point of intersection (as in \hyperref[solvinghyper]{Figure~\ref{solvinghyper}} below), we see that \(80=a \cosh\left( \frac{140}{a} \right) +30-a\) when \(a \approx 203.82\).%

\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-2587}{}%
Using the value of \(a \approx 203.82\) together with \(30=a+b\) we have \(b=-173.82\). Therefore, the height of the bridge can be modeled by the equation%
\begin{equation*}
h(x)=203.82 \cosh\left(\frac{x}{203.82}\right) - 173.82\text{.}

One of the powerful consequences of a function \(y = f(x)\) being differentiable at a point \((a,f(a))\) is that up close the function \(y = f(x)\) is locally linear and looks like its tangent line at that point. In certain circumstances, this allows us to approximate the original function \(f\) with a simpler function \(L\) that is linear: this can be advantageous when we have limited information about \(f\) or when \(f\) is computationally or algebraically complicated. We will explore all of these situations in what follows.%

\hypertarget{p-2597}{}%
It is essential to recall that when \(f\) is differentiable at \(x = a\), the value of \(f'(a)\) provides the slope of the tangent line to \(y = f(x)\) at the point \((a,f(a))\). If we know both a point on the line and the slope of the line we can find the equation of the tangent line and write the equation in point-slope form.\footnote{Recall that a line with slope \(m\) that passes through \((x_0,y_0)\) has equation \(y - y_0 = m(x - x_0)\), and this is the \terminology{point-slope form} of the equation.\label{fn-24}}%

Since the limit definition of the derivative says that%

we first compute%

\hypertarget{p-2627}{}%
A slight change in perspective and notation will enable us to be more precise in discussing how the tangent line approximates \(f(x)\) near \(x = a\). By solving for \(y\), we can write the equation for the tangent line as%
\begin{equation*}
y = f'(a)(x-a) + f(a)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
This line is itself a function of \(x\). Replacing the variable \(y\) with the expression \(L(x)\), we have the following. \begin{assemblage}[Local Linearization]\label{assemblage-77}
\hypertarget{p-2628}{}%
We call%
\begin{equation*}
L(x) = f'(a)(x-a) + f(a)
\end{equation*}
the \terminology{local linearization of \(f\) \index{local linearization} \index{tangent line approximation} at the point \((a,f(a))\)}.%
\end{assemblage}
 In this notation, \(L(x)\) is nothing more than a "new name" for the tangent line. As we saw above, for \(x\) close to \(a\), \(f(x) \approx L(x)\). For this reason, \(L(x)\) is also called the \terminology{tangent line approximation to \(f\) at \((a,f(a))\)}.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-127}
\hypertarget{p-2629}{}%
Suppose that all we know about a function \(f\) is that its tangent line approximation at the point \((1,3)\) is given by \(L(x) = 3 - 2(x-1)\). To estimate a value of \(f(x)\) for \(x\) near \(1\), such as \(f(1.2)\), we can use the fact that \(f(1.2) \approx L(1.2)\). Hence%
\begin{equation*}
f(1.2) \approx L(1.2) = 3 - 2(1.2-1) = 3 - 2(0.2) = 2.6\text{.}

We start by computing \(p'(t)\), and then evaluating \(p(1)\) and \(p'(1)\). Since \(p(t)=\ln(t)\), the derivative is \(p'(t)=\frac1t\). Furthermore, we have \(p(1)=\ln(1)=0\) and \(p'(1)=\frac11=1\). Thus, the local linearization of \(p(t)=\ln(t)\) at the point \((1,0)\) is%
\begin{equation*}
L(t)=p(1)+p'(1)(t-1)=0+1(t-1)=t-1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-1729}{}\hypertarget{p-2645}{}%
Since we can use the tangent line approximation for \(p\) at \((1,0)\) to estimate output values of \(p\) at nearby points, it follows that \(p(1.01)\approx L(1.01)\). Thus we have%
\begin{equation*}
\ln(1.01)\approx0.01\text{.}

%
\item\hypertarget{li-1730}{}\hypertarget{p-2646}{}%
Since we can use the tangent line approximation for \(p\) at \((1,0)\) to estimate output values of \(p\) at nearby points, it follows that \(p(1.3)\approx L(1.3)\). Thus we have%
\begin{equation*}
\ln(1.3)\approx0.3\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-1731}{}\hypertarget{p-2647}{}%
Since \(1.3\) is farther away from the point of tangency \((t=1)\) than \(1.01\) is, we expect the estimate to be better for \(1.01\). We confirm this by computing the error at each point, finding that%
\begin{align*}
E(1.01)\amp=p(1.01)-L(1.01)\\
\amp=\ln(1.01)-0.01\\
\amp\approx-0.0000497,\\

\index{tangent line approximation!properties} \index{local linearization!properties} In \hyperref[act-1-8-1]{Example~\ref{act-1-8-1}}, we saw that the local linearization \(L\) is a linear function that shares two important values with the function \(f\) that it is derived from. In particular, \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}because \(L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)\), it follows that \(L(a) = f(a)\); and%
\item{}because \(L\) is a linear function, its derivative is its slope. Hence, \(L'(x) = f'(a)\) for every value of \(x\), and specifically \(L'(a) = f'(a)\).%
\end{itemize}
 Therefore, we see that \(L\) is a linear function that has both the same value and the same slope as the function \(f\) at the point \((a,f(a))\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2678}{}%
Thus, if we know the linear approximation \(y = L(x)\) for a function \(f\), we know the original function's value and its slope at the point of tangency. What remains unknown, however, is the shape of the function \(f\) at the point of tangency. There are essentially four possibilities, as shown below in \hyperref[F-1-8-Options]{Figure~\ref{F-1-8-Options}}.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/1_8_Options.pdf}
\caption{Four possible graphs for a nonlinear differentiable function (in blue) and how it can be situated relative to its tangent line (in green) at a point. Note that these cases correspond to a tangent line with positive slope. There are four similar possibilities when the slope of the tangent line is negative or zero.\label{F-1-8-Options}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-2679}{}%
These possible shapes result from the fact that there are three options for the value of the second derivative: either \(f''(a) \lt 0\), \(f''(a) = 0\), or \(f''(a) \gt 0\). \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}If \(f''(a) \gt 0\), then we know the graph of \(f\) is concave up, and we see the first possibility on the left, where the tangent line lies entirely below the curve.%
\item{}If \(f''(a) \lt 0\), then \(f\) is concave down and the tangent line lies above the curve, as shown in the second image.%
\item{}If \(f''(a) = 0\) and \(f''\) changes sign at \(x = a\), the concavity of the graph will change, and we will see either the third or fourth image.\footnote{It is possible that \(f''(a) = 0\) but \(f''\) does not change sign at \(x = a\), in which case the graph will look like one of the first two options.\label{fn-25}}%
\item{}A fifth option (which is not very interesting) can occur if the function \(f\) itself is linear, so that \(f''(x)=0\) and \(f(x) = L(x)\) for all values of \(x\).%
\end{itemize}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2680}{}%
The plots in \hyperref[F-1-8-Options]{Figure~\ref{F-1-8-Options}} highlight yet another important thing that we can learn from the concavity of the graph near the point of tangency: whether the tangent line lies above or below the curve itself. This is key because it tells us whether or not the tangent line approximation's values will be too large or too small in comparison to the true value of \(f\). For instance, in the leftmost plot in \hyperref[F-1-8-Options]{Figure~\ref{F-1-8-Options}} where \(f''(a) > 0\), we know that \(L(x) \le f(x)\) for all values of \(x\) near \(a\) because the tangent line falls below the curve.%

The slope of the tangent line to \(y = f(x)\) is increasing for \(x \lt 2\) because \(y = f'(x)\) is an increasing function on this interval. Similarly, for \(x > 2\), the slope of the tangent line to \(y = f(x)\) is decreasing. Right at \(x = 2\), the slope of the tangent line to \(y = f(x)\) is neither increasing nor decreasing. This can also be seen in the sketch of \(y=f''(x)\), where we have \(f''(x)\) decreasing with a root at \(2\) (so \(f''\) is positive to the left and negative to the right of \(x=2\)).%

Note that \(y = f(x)\) is concave up for \(x \lt 2\) since \(f'\) is increasing on that interval, and \(y = f(x)\) is concave down for \(x > 2\) since \(f'\) is decreasing there.

We also observe that \(f\) is decreasing for \(x \lt 0\) and \(x\gt4\) since \(f'\) is negative on those intervals. Likewise, \(f\) is increasing for \(0\lt x\lt 4\) because \(f'\) is positive on that interval.%

As noted in part (e), the function \(f\) is concave down for \(x>2\). Consequently, the tangent line approximation for \(f\) at \(x=2\) lies above the graph of \(y=f(x)\) to the right of this point. In other words, \(L(2.07)\gt f(2.07)\), and our estimate in (b) was an overestimate for the true value of \(f(2.07)\).%
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{p-2715}{}%
The idea that a differentiable function looks linear and can be well-approximated by a linear function is an important one that is widely applied in calculus. For example, it is possible to develop an effective algorithm to estimate the zeroes of a function by approximating the function with its local linearization. Local linearity also helps us to make further sense of certain challenging limits. For instance, the limit%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x}
\end{equation*}
is indeterminate, because both its numerator and denominator tend to 0. While there is no algebra that we can do to simplify \(\frac{\sin(x)}{x}\), it is straightforward to show that the linearization of \(f(x) = \sin(x)\) at the point \((0,0)\) is given by \(L(x) = x\). Hence \(\sin(x)\approx x\) for values of \(x\) near 0, and therefore%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\sin(x)}{x} \approx \frac{x}{x} = 1
\end{equation*}
near \(x=0\). This makes plausible the fact that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1\text{.}
\end{equation*}

The tangent line to a differentiable function \(y = f(x)\) at the point \((a,f(a))\) is given in point-slope form by the equation%
\begin{equation*}
y - f(a) = f'(a)(x-a)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-2718}{}%
The principle of local linearity tells us that if we zoom in on a point where a function \(y = f(x)\) is differentiable, the function will be indistinguishable from its tangent line. That is, a differentiable function looks linear when viewed up close. We rename the tangent line to be the function \(y = L(x)\), where \(L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)\). Thus, \(f(x) \approx L(x)\) for all \(x\) near \(x = a\).%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-2719}{}%
If we know the tangent line approximation \(L(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)\) to a function \(f\), then because \(L(a) = f(a)\) and \(L'(a) = f'(a)\), we also know the values of both the function and its derivative at the point where \(x = a\). In other words, the linear approximation tells us the height and slope of the original function. If in addition we know the value of \(f''(a)\), we then know whether the tangent line lies above or below the graph of \(y = f(x)\), depending on the concavity of \(f\).%

This implies that near \(t=60\), the graph of \(L(t)\) (the tangent line to \(F\) at \(t=60)\) lies above the graph of \(F\).

The linearization \(L\) of \(s\) at \(t=a\) is \(L(t) = s(a) + s'(a)(t-a)\). With the information we have we can find the linearization of \(s\) at \(t=9\), using the facts that \(s(9) = 4\) and \(s'(9) = -1.2\). Thus, the linearization of \(s\) at \(t=9\) is \(L(t) = 4 - 1.2(t-9)\). One use of the linearization is that for \(t\) close to \(9\), \(L(t)\) can provide a good approximation to \(s(t)\). So%
\begin{equation*}
s(9.34) \approx L(9.34) = 4-1.2(0.34) = 3.592\text{.}

\item\hypertarget{li-1823}{}\hypertarget{p-2760}{}%
Since \(s''(4) = 0.08\) is positive, we know that the graph of \(s\) is concave up at \(t=4\). This means that the linearization of \(s\) at \(t=4\) lies below the graph of \(s\) and so \(L(9.34)\) is an underestimate to \(s(9.34)\).%

Given that \(s'(4)\) is negative, the object is moving back toward its original position. The fact that \(s''(4)\) is positive means that the velocity of the object is increasing at \(t=4\).

The tangent line approximation at \(a = 2\) is \(L(x) = f(2) + f'(2)(x-2) \approx 0.0182 + -0.05495(x-2)\). Thus, \(f(1.88) \approx L(1.88) \approx 0.0182 + -0.05495(1.88-2) = 0.02479\). Since \(f''(x) \lt 0\) at and around \(x = 2\), \(f\) is concave down there, and therefore the tangent line lies above the curve. This makes our estimate larger than the true value of \(f(1.88)\).%

Can we use \emph{global} information about a function (for instance, the average rate of change) to say anything about the \emph{local} behavior of the function (such as the instantaneous rate of change)?%
\end{itemize}
\end{objectives}
\hypertarget{p-2775}{}%
When you know how a function behaves at every point, you know quite a lot about that function. This is the whole idea behind plotting points on a coordinate plane in order to determine what the graph of a function looks like. Indeed, given enough local information about a function, we can describe it very well globally. However, the opposite is not generally true. Suppose, for instance, that you know the graph of \(y=f(x)\) is a parabola. Knowing that, can you determine the value of \(f(3)\)? The answer, of course, is that you do not have enough information.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2776}{}%
In general, global information is not enough to determine local information. In other words, knowing how a function behaves overall is not usually enough to say anything about how the function behaves at a specific point. However, there are some exceptions to this generalization. One such special case is the \terminology{mean value theorem}.%

Since \(59\) miles were driven in \(\frac34\) hours, the average speed (i.e. average rate of change) on the trip was%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{59\text{ miles}}{\frac34\text{ hours}}=\frac{59\cdot4}3\approx78.67\text{ mph}\text{.}

Because this is an average, our intuition tells us that at some point on the trip the car must have been going at least as fast as \(78.67\) miles per hour. This is precisely what the mean value theorem addresses.%

While a proof of the mean value theorem is beyond the scope of this textbook, it is worth rephrasing the theorem in a way that is perhaps more clear. The mean value theorem essentially states that given any two points on a continuous curve, there is a point somewhere in the middle at which the line tangent to the curve is parallel to the secant line that connects the two points. A geometric representation of this is illustrated below in \hyperref[mvt]{Figure~\ref{mvt}}.%

The secant line connecting the points \((a,f(a))\) and \((b,f(b))\) is shown in black and has slope \(\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\). There appears to be at least one point, \(c\), between \(a\) and \(b\) at which the slope of the tangent line (shown in red) is precisely the same as the slope of the secant line.\label{mvt}}

\hypertarget{p-2787}{}%
The mean value theorem has several important consequences that confirm some intuitive ideas that you may already hold. First, the \terminology{increasing function theorem} establishes that continuous functions with a positive derivative on an interval are increasing on that interval.  More formally,%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2788}{}%
\begin{assemblage}[The Increasing Function Theorem]\label{assemblage-79}
\hypertarget{p-2789}{}%
Suppose that \(f\) is continuous on \(a \leq x \leq b\) and differentiable on \(a \lt x \lt b\). \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}If \(f'(x)>0\) on \(a \lt x \lt b\), then \(f\) is increasing on \(a \leq x \leq  b\).%
\item{}If \(f'(x) \geq 0\) on \(a \lt x \lt b\), then \(f\) is non-decreasing on \(a \leq x \leq  b\).%
\end{itemize}
%
\end{assemblage}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2790}{}%
This theorem is demonstrated in \hyperref[ift]{Figure~\ref{ift}}. When the slope of the tangent line is positive for all \(x\) values on a given interval, we see that the function is increasing.%
\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/2-10-increasingfunction.gif}

\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-2791}{}%
We can also state that a function with a derivative equal to zero on an interval is constant on that interval.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2792}{}%
\begin{assemblage}[Constant Function Theorem]\label{assemblage-80}
\hypertarget{p-2793}{}%
Suppose that \(f\) is continuous on \(a \leq x \leq b\) and differentiable on \(a \lt x \lt b\).  If \(f '(x) = 0\) on \(a \lt x \lt b\), then \(f\) is constant on \(a \leq x \leq b\). Equivalently, if \(f\) is \emph{not} constant everywhere on \([a,b]\), then there is some point \(c\) on the interval \((a,b)\) at which \(f'(c)\neq0\).%
\end{assemblage}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2794}{}%
The following example will provide some intuition for the constant function theorem.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-133}
\hypertarget{p-2795}{}%
Suppose a car is being driven with cruise control set to \(55\) miles per hour, and that the drive continues for \(30\) minutes. Thinking of the car's velocity (in miles per hour) as a function of time (in minutes), the instantaneous rate of change of velocity (i.e., the instantaneous acceleration) at each minute of the drive is \(0\) miles per hour per minute. In terms of function notation, we have \(v=f(t)\) denoting the velocity as a function of time, and \(a=f'(t)\) denoting the acceleration as the derivative of velocity, with \(f'(t)=0\) for each \(0\lt t\lt30\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2796}{}%
Suppose now that the car approaches a red light, leading the driver to turn off cruise control in order to slow down and eventually stop. However, cruise control is only off for \(15\) seconds before the light turns green again, at which point the driver resets the cruise control and regains a speed of \(55\) mph within a further \(15\) seconds. When cruise control was turned off, the car slowed down a little bit before returning to cruising speed. Consequently, the instantaneous acceleration was nonzero during that \(30\) second period. In other words, when the (velocity) function is not constant over an interval, its derivative (acceleration) is nonzero on that same interval.%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-2797}{}%
We have one final result that can be used to formalize another intuitive idea.  The \terminology{racetrack principle} argues that if two objects begin at the same place and the same time and one is traveling faster than the other, then the faster object will be ahead of the slower object.  Formally, we write the principle in terms of functions.%

\begin{equation*}
h'(x)=1.

\par
\hypertarget{p-2807}{}%
Since ``\(x\ge1\)'' and ``\(\frac1x\le1\)'' are equivalent statements, we thus have \(g'(x)\leq h'(x)\) for all \(x\geq 1\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2808}{}%
Comparing function values when \(x=1\), we see that \(g(1)=\ln(1)=0\) and \(h(1)=1-1=0\). Therefore the racetrack principle says \(g(x)\leq h(x)\) (i.e. \(\ln(x)\leq x-1 \)) for all \(x\geq 1\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2809}{}%
Similarly, if we consider values \(0\lt x \leq 1\), we have that \(g'(x)\geq h'(x)\). Since \(g(1)=h(1)\), we have that \(h(x)\geq g(x)\) or \(x-1\geq \ln(x)\) for all \(0\lt x\leq 1\). Note that we have to be careful in applying the racetrack principle here, since \(\ln(x)\) is not continuous (because it's undefined) at \(x=0\). But we can choose the lower bound of the interval to be any positive number less than \(1\), and then take the limit as that number approaches \(0\) to obtain the result.%

We have already identified the global maximum of \(g\) as \(g(c)\); it can also be considered a relative maximum. Another piece of terminology to be familiar with is that any maximum or minimum may also be called an \terminology{extreme value} \index{extreme value} of \(f\).%

We would like to use calculus ideas to identify and classify key function behavior, including the location of relative extrema.

\item\hypertarget{li-1866}{}\hypertarget{p-2851}{}%
The graph shows that \(h(x)\le-1=h(-2)\) for every \(x\) near \(-2\) and \(h(x)\le2=h(1)\) for every \(x\) near \(1\). We notice that these are points where \(h\) switches from increasing to decreasing. Since there are no other points on the graph where the \(y\)-coordinate is larger than everything nearby, it follows that the only local maxima of \(h\) on this domain occur at \(c=-2\) and \(c=1\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-1867}{}\hypertarget{p-2852}{}%
The graph shows that \(h(x)\ge-2=h(0)\) for every \(x\) near \(0\), a point where \(h\) switches from decreasing to increasing. Since this is the only point shown where this occurs, we say that the only local minimum of \(h\) on this domain occurs at \(c=0\). %
\item\hypertarget{li-1868}{}\hypertarget{p-2853}{}%
The highest point shown on the graph is the point \((1,2)\). Since \(h\) is continuous on \([-3,3]\), we don't have to worry about any points on the interval being higher and not showing up on the displayed grid. Hence we say the global maximum of \(h\) on the interval \([-3,3]\) is \(2\) and occurs at \(x=1\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-1869}{}\hypertarget{p-2854}{}%
The lowest point shown on the graph is the point \((-3,-3)\). Again, since \(h\) is continuous on \([-3,3]\), we don't have to worry about any points on the interval being lower and not showing up in the window that is displayed. Thus we say the global minimum of \(h\) on the interval \([-3,3]\) is \(-3\) and occurs at \(x=-3\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2855}{}%
It is worth noting that this was not a point that we found as a local minimum. The difference is that here we are restricting our focus to the interval that is shown, effectively cutting off the graph at its endpoints. Earlier, when we were looking for relative minima, we made the assumption that the graph of \(y=h(x)\) continues outside of the depicted interval by following the trends displayed and continuing downward on both sides.%
\item\hypertarget{li-1870}{}\hypertarget{p-2856}{}%
When looking for points \((c,h(c))\) at which \(h'(c)=0\), we are looking for points of horizontal tangency. The graph flattens out at \((-2.5,-2)\) and \((1,2)\), but nowhere else\footnote{Note that at \((1.5,1)\) it looks as though the graph is flat to the right of this point. However, the derivative is undefined here because of the cusp, so this is not a point of horizontal tangency\label{fn-26}}. Thus \(h'(c)=0\) exactly when \(c=-2.5\) and \(c=1\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-1871}{}\hypertarget{p-2857}{}%
Recall that \(h'(c)\) only exists when all of the following are true: %
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-2858}{}%
\(h(c)\) is defined,%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-2859}{}%
\(\lim_{x\to c}h(x)\) exists,%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-2860}{}%
\(\lim_{x\to c}h(x)=h(c)\), and%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-2861}{}%
\(\lim_{a\to0}\frac{h(c+a)-h(c)}a\) exists.%
\end{itemize}
 Assuming \(h\) is continuous at \(c\) (i.e. the first three points hold), the main consequence of the final point is that a corner or a cusp at \((c,h(c))\) makes \(h\) nondifferentiable at \(c\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2862}{}%
With all this in mind, we can say that \(h'(c)\) does not exist at \(c=-2\), \(c=0\), or \(c=1.5\) because \(h\) has a cusp at these points. %
\item\hypertarget{li-1876}{}\hypertarget{p-2863}{}%
This is true. Every relative extremum of \(h\) occurs at a point where \(h'(c)\) is either zero or does not exist.%
\item\hypertarget{li-1877}{}\hypertarget{p-2864}{}%
This is false. Some points at which \(h'(c)\) is zero or undefined are not relative extrema. In particular, \(h'(-2.5)\) is zero, but the graph is non-decreasing near \((-2.5,-2)\). Similarly, \(h'(1.5)\) is undefined, but the graph is non-increasing near \((1.5,1)\). Neither of these points is a local maximum or minimum.%

Suppose a function \(f\) is continuous on an open interval \((a,b)\). If \(f\) has a relative maximum at some number \(c\) in this interval, then \(f\) must be increasing in some interval just before \(c\) and decreasing in some interval just after \(c\).  These intervals could be quite small.  Conversely, if \(f\) is increasing in an interval just before \(c\) and decreasing in an interval just after \(c\), then \(f\) must have a relative maximum at \(c\). The natural analogue holds for relative minima: if \(f\) has a relative minimum at some number \(c\) in this interval, then \(f\) is decreasing in some interval just before \(c\) and increasing just after \(c\).  Conversely, if \(f\) is decreasing in some interval just before \(c\) and decreasing in an interval just after \(c\), then \(f\) must have a relative minimum at \(c\). (See \hyperref[F-3-1-extremes]{Figure~\ref{F-3-1-extremes}} above.) There are only two possible ways for these changes in behavior to occur: either \(f'(c) = 0\) or \(f'(c)\) is undefined. Because these values of \(c\) are so important, we call the point \((c,f(c))\) a critical point.%

Since we already have \(f'(x)\) written in factored form, it is straightforward to find the critical numbers of \(f\). Because \(f'(x)\) is defined for all values of \(x\), we need only determine where \(f'(x) = 0\). From the equation%
\begin{equation*}
e^{-2x}(3-x)(x+1)^2 = 0
\end{equation*}
and the zero product property\footnote{The zero product property says that if \(ab=0\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are expressions representing real numbers (e.g. \(a=(3-x)\), where \(x\) is a real number), then it must be the case that \(a=0\) or \(b=0\) (or both).\label{fn-28}}, it follows that \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\) are critical numbers of \(f\). (There is no value of \(x\) that makes \(e^{-2x} = 0\).)%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2875}{}%
Next, to apply the first derivative test, we'd like to know the sign of \(f'(x)\) at inputs near the critical numbers. Because the critical numbers are the only locations at which \(f'\) can change sign, it follows that the sign of the derivative is the same on each of the intervals created by the critical numbers: for instance, the sign of \(f'\) must be the same for every \(x \lt -1\). What this means is that we can choose (carefully) where to evaluate the derivative in order to ascertain its sign on a given interval. Since \(f'(-1.000001)\) and \(f'(-2)\) must have the same sign, we may as well evaluate \(f'(x)\) at \(-2\) to figure out the sign of \(f'\) for \(x\lt -1\). We create a first derivative sign chart (displayed below, with explanation following) to summarize the sign of \(f'\) on the relevant intervals, along with the corresponding behavior of \(f\).%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.65\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/3_1_signchart.pdf}
\caption{The first derivative sign chart for a function \(f\) whose derivative is given by the formula \(f'(x) = e^{-2x}(3-x)(x+1)^2\).\label{F-3-1-signchart}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-2876}{}%
To produce the first derivative sign chart in \hyperref[F-3-1-signchart]{Figure~\ref{F-3-1-signchart}}, we start by marking the critical numbers \(-1\) and \(3\) on the number line. We then identify the sign of each factor of \(f'(x)\) at one selected point in each interval. The intervals in this example are \(x\lt-1\), \(-1\lt x\lt3\), and \(x\gt3\); we will choose \(x=-2\), \(x=0\), and \(x=5\) for our selected points. The process with \(x=-2\) is laid out below:%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2877}{}%
For \(x \lt -1\), we use the value \(x=-2\) to determine the sign of \(e^{-2x}\), \((3-x)\), and \((x+1)^2\). We note that \(e^{-2x}\) is positive regardless of the value of \(x\), \((x+1)^2\) is positive whenever it is nonzero \textemdash{} which is everywhere within the intervals of interest since we intentionally plucked out the zeros \textemdash{} and that \((3-x)\) is also positive at \(x = -2\). Hence each of the three terms in \(f'\) is positive, and we indicate this by writing ``\(+++\)'' above the interval \(x\lt-1\). Taking the product of three positive terms results in a positive value for \(f'\), so we denote the sign of \(f'\) by a ``\(+\)'' above the appropriate interval in the chart. Finally, since \(f'\) is positive on that interval, we know that \(f\) is increasing, so we write ``INC'' to represent the behavior of \(f\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2878}{}%
In a similar fashion, we find that \(f'\) is positive (because \(3-(0)\gt0\) and the other terms are also still positive) and \(f\) is increasing on \(-1 \lt x \lt 3\), and that \(f'\) is negative (because \(3-(5)\lt0\) but the other terms are still positive) and \(f\) is decreasing for \(x \gt 3\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2879}{}%
Now we look for critical numbers at which \(f'\) changes sign. In this example, \(f'\) changes sign only at \(x = 3\), from positive to negative, so \(f\) has a relative maximum at \(x = 3\). Although \(f\) has a critical number at \(x = -1\), since \(f\) is increasing both before and after \(x = -1\), \(f\) has neither a minimum nor a maximum at \(x = -1\).%

Since \(g'(x) = \frac{(x+4)(x-1)^2}{x-2}\), we see that \(g'(x) = 0\) implies that \(x = -4\) or \(x = 1\). Although \(x = 2\) makes \(g'\) undefined, we are told that \(g\) has a vertical asymptote at \(x = 2\). So \(x = 2\) is not in the domain of \(g\), and hence is technically not a critical number of \(g\). Nonetheless, we place \(x = 2\) on our first derivative sign chart since the vertical asymptote is a location at which \(g'\) may change sign.%
\item\hypertarget{li-1894}{}\hypertarget{p-2900}{}%
The first derivative sign chart shows that: %
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\(g'(x) \gt 0\) for \(x \lt -4\),%
\item{}\(g'(x) \lt 0\) for \(-4 \lt x \lt 1\),%
\item{}\(g'(x) \lt 0\) for \(1 \lt x \lt 2\), and%
\item{}\(g'(x) \gt 0\) for \(x \gt 2\).%
\end{itemize}
 By the first derivative test, \(g\) has a local maximum at \(x = -4\) and neither a max nor min at \(x = 1\). As these are the only two critical numbers, these are the only two locations for possible extrema. (Note: although \(g\) changes from decreasing to increasing at \(x = 2\), this is due to a vertical asymptote, and \(g\) does not have a minimum there.)%
\item\hypertarget{li-1899}{}\hypertarget{p-2901}{}%
Because \(g\) is decreasing as \(x \to 2^-\) (where \(g\) has a vertical asymptote), \(g\) does not have a global minimum. For \(x \gt 2\), \(g\) is always increasing, which suggests that \(g\) does not have a global maximum (though we do not know for sure that \(g\) increases without bound; this is explored in part (d)).%
\item\hypertarget{li-1900}{}\hypertarget{p-2902}{}%
We observe that%
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x \to \infty} g'(x) =\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{(x+4)(x-1)^2}{x-2}\\
=\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^3 + 2x^2 - 7x + 4}{x-2} \cdot \frac{\frac{1}{x}}{\frac{1}{x}}\\
=\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2 + 2x - 7 + \frac{4}{x}}{1 - \frac{2}{x}}\\
=\mathstrut \amp  \infty
\end{align*}

\subsection[{The Second Derivative Test}]{The Second Derivative Test}\label{subsection-84}
\hypertarget{p-2904}{}%
Recall that the second derivative of a function tells us several important things about the behavior of the function itself. For instance, if \(f''\) is positive on an interval, then we know that on that interval \(f'\) is increasing and, consequently, that \(f\) is concave up. Hence throughout that interval the tangent line to \(y = f(x)\) lies below the curve at every point. At a point where \(f'(p) = 0\), the sign of the second derivative determines whether \(f\) has a local minimum or local maximum at the critical number \(p\).%
\begin{figure}

\caption{Four possible graphs of a function \(f\) with a horizontal tangent line at a critical point.\label{F-3-1-2Dtest}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-2905}{}%
In \hyperref[F-3-1-2Dtest]{Figure~\ref{F-3-1-2Dtest}} above, we see the four possibilities for a function \(f\) that has a critical number \(p\) at which \(f'(p) = 0\), provided \(f''(p)\) is not zero on an interval including \(p\) (except possibly at \(p\)). On either side of the critical number, \(f''\) can be either positive or negative, and hence \(f\) can be either concave up or concave down. In the first two graphs, \(f\) does not change concavity at \(p\) and \(f\) has either a local minimum or local maximum in those situations. In particular, if \(f'(p) = 0\) and \(f''(p) \lt 0\), then \(f\) is concave down at \(p\) with a horizontal tangent line, so \(f\) has a local maximum there. This fact, along with the corresponding statement for when \(f''(p)\) is positive, is the substance of the second derivative test.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2906}{}%
\begin{assemblage}[Second Derivative Test]\label{Second-D-Test}
\hypertarget{p-2907}{}%
\index{second derivative test} If \(p\) is a critical number of a continuous function \(f\) such that \(f'(p) = 0\) and \(f''(p) \ne 0\), then \(f\) has a relative maximum at \(p\) if and only if \(f''(p) \lt 0\), and \(f\) has a relative minimum at \(p\) if and only if \(f''(p) \gt 0\).%
\end{assemblage}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2908}{}%
In the event that \(f''(p) = 0\), the second derivative test is inconclusive. That is, the test doesn't provide us any information. This is because if \(f''(p) = 0\), it is possible that \(f\) has a local minimum, local maximum, or neither.\footnote{Consider the functions \(f(x) = x^4\), \(g(x) = -x^4\), and \(h(x) = x^3\) at the critical point \(p = 0\).\label{fn-29}}%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2909}{}%
Just as a first derivative sign chart reveals all of the increasing and decreasing behavior of a function, we can construct a second derivative sign chart that demonstrates all of the important information involving concavity.%
\begin{example}[]\label{Ex-3-2}
\hypertarget{p-2910}{}%
Let \(f\) be a function whose first derivative is \(f'(x) = 3x^4 - 9x^2\). Construct both first and second derivative sign charts for \(f\); fully discuss where \(f\) is increasing, decreasing, concave up, and concave down; identify all relative extreme values; and sketch a possible graph of \(f\).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-154}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-2911}{}%
Since we know \(f'(x) = 3x^4 - 9x^2\), we can find the critical numbers of \(f\) by solving \(3x^4 - 9x^2 = 0\). Factoring, we observe that%
\begin{equation*}
0 = 3x^2(x^2 - 3) = 3x^2(x+\sqrt{3})(x-\sqrt{3})\text{,}
\end{equation*}
so that \(x = 0, \pm\sqrt{3}\) are the three critical numbers of \(f\). The first derivative sign chart for \(f\) is given below in \hyperref[F-3-1-signchart2]{Figure~\ref{F-3-1-signchart2}}.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/3_1_signchart2.pdf}
\caption{The first derivative sign chart for \(f\) when \(f'(x) = 3x^4 - 9x^2 = 3x^2(x^2-3)\).\label{F-3-1-signchart2}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-2912}{}%
We see that \(f\) is increasing on the intervals \((-\infty, -\sqrt{3})\) and \((\sqrt{3}, \infty)\), and \(f\) is decreasing on \((-\sqrt{3},0)\) and \((0, \sqrt{3})\). By the first derivative test, this information tells us that \(f\) has a local maximum at \(x = -\sqrt{3}\) and a local minimum at \(x = \sqrt{3}\). Although \(f\) also has a critical number at \(x = 0\), neither a maximum nor minimum occurs there since \(f'\) does not change sign at \(x = 0\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2913}{}%
Next, we move on to investigate concavity. Differentiating \(f'(x) = 3x^4 - 9x^2\), we see that \(f''(x) = 12x^3 - 18x\). Since we are interested in knowing the intervals on which \(f''\) is positive and negative, we first find where \(f''(x) = 0\). Observe that%
\begin{equation*}
0 = 12x^3 - 18x = 12x\left(x^2 - \frac{3}{2}\right) = 12x\left(x+\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}\right)\left(x-\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}\right)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
This equation has solutions \(x = 0, \pm\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}\). Building a sign chart for \(f''\) in the exact same way we do for \(f'\), we see the result shown below in \hyperref[F-3-1-signchart3]{Figure~\ref{F-3-1-signchart3}}.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/3_1_signchart3.pdf}
\caption{The second derivative sign chart for \(f\) when \(f''(x) = 12x^3-18x = 12x^2\left(x^2-\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}\right)\).\label{F-3-1-signchart3}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-2914}{}%
Therefore \(f\) is concave down on the intervals \(\left(-\infty, -\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}\right)\) and \(\left(0, \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}\right)\), and concave up on \(\left(-\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}},0\right)\) and \(\left(\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}, \infty\right)\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2915}{}%
Putting all of this information together, we now see a complete and accurate possible graph of \(f\) in \hyperref[F-3-1-Ex2]{Figure~\ref{F-3-1-Ex2}}.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.65\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/3_1_Ex2.pdf}
\caption{A possible graph of the function \(f\) in \hyperref[Ex-3-2]{Example~\ref{Ex-3-2}}.\label{F-3-1-Ex2}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-2916}{}%
The point \(A = (-\sqrt{3}, f(-\sqrt{3}))\) is a local maximum, because \(f\) is increasing prior to \(A\) and decreasing after; similarly, the point \(E = (\sqrt{3}, f(\sqrt{3})\) is a local minimum. Note, too, that \(f\) is concave down at \(A\) and concave up at \(E\), which is consistent both with our second derivative sign chart and the second derivative test. At points \(B\) and \(D\), concavity changes, as we saw in the results of the second derivative sign chart in \hyperref[F-3-1-signchart3]{Figure~\ref{F-3-1-signchart3}}. Finally, at point \(C\), \(f\) has a critical point with a horizontal tangent line, but neither a maximum nor a minimum occurs there, since \(f\) is decreasing both before and after \(C\). It is also the case that concavity changes at \(C\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2917}{}%
While we completely understand where \(f\) is increasing and decreasing, where \(f\) is concave up and concave down, and where \(f\) has relative extrema, we do not know any specific information about the \(y\)-coordinates of points on the curve. For instance, while we know that \(f\) has a local maximum at \(x = -\sqrt{3}\), we don't know the value of that maximum because we do not know \(f(-\sqrt{3})\). Any vertical translation of our sketch of \(f\) in \hyperref[F-3-1-Ex2]{Figure~\ref{F-3-1-Ex2}} would satisfy the given criteria for \(f\).%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-2918}{}%
Points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) in \hyperref[F-3-1-Ex2]{Figure~\ref{F-3-1-Ex2}} are locations at which the concavity of \(f\) changes. We give a special name to any such point.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2919}{}%
\begin{assemblage}[Inflection Point]\label{assemblage-87}
\hypertarget{p-2920}{}%
Let \(f\) be a continuous function. If \(p\) is a point in the domain of \(f\) at which \(f\) changes concavity, then we say that \((p,f(p))\) is an \terminology{inflection point} \index{inflection point} (or \terminology{point of inflection}) of \(f\).%
\end{assemblage}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2921}{}%
Just as we look for locations where \(f\) changes from increasing to decreasing at points where \(f'(p) = 0\) or \(f'(p)\) is undefined, so too we find where \(f''(p) = 0\) or \(f''(p)\) is undefined to see if there are points of inflection at these locations.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2922}{}%
At this point in our study, it is important to remind ourselves of the big picture that derivatives help to paint: the sign of the first derivative \(f'\) tells us \emph{whether} the function \(f\) is increasing or decreasing, while the sign of the second derivative \(f''\) tells us \emph{how} the function \(f\) is increasing or decreasing.%

As we will see in more detail in the following section, derivatives also help us to understand families of functions that differ only by changing one or more parameters.

If \(\frac{2}{k^2} \gt 1\), then the equation \(\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}\) has no solution. Hence, whenever \(k^2 \lt 2\), or \(k \lt \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414\), it follows that the equation \(\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}\) has no solutions \(x\), which means that \(h''(x)\) is never zero (indeed, for these \(k\)-values, \(h''(x)\) is always positive so that \(h\) is always concave up). On the other hand, if \(k \ge \sqrt{2}\) then \(\frac{2}{k^2} \le 1\), which guarantees that \(\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}\) has infinitely many solutions due to the periodicity of the cosine function. At each such point, \(h''(x)\) changes sign if and only if \(k\gt\sqrt{2}\). (In the case where \(k=\sqrt2\), the function \(h''\) has infinitely many zeros but is always non-negative.) Therefore \(h\) has infinitely many inflection points whenever \(k \gt \sqrt{2}\), and no inflection points otherwise.%

To see why \(h\) can only have a finite number of critical numbers regardless of the value of \(k\), consider the equation%

which implies that \(2x = k\sin(kx)\). Since \(-1 \le \sin(kx) \le 1\), we know that \(-k \le k\sin(kx) \le k\). Once \(|x|\) is sufficiently large, we are guaranteed that \(|2x| \gt k\), which means that for large values of \(x\), the graphs of \(y=2x\) and \(y=k\sin(kx)\) cannot intersect. Moreover, for relatively small values of \(x\), the functions \(2x\) and \(k\sin(kx)\) can only intersect finitely many times since \(k\sin(kx)\) only oscillates a finite number of times on a fixed interval. This is why \(h\) can only have a finite number of critical numbers, regardless of the value of \(k\).%

Close inspection of the light blue graph reveals some subtle changes in concavity around \(x \approx \pm 0.5\). For values smaller than \(1.6\), it is very hard to visually detect any inflection points in \(h(x)\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-1928}{}\hypertarget{p-2961}{}%
Treating \(k\) as an arbitrary constant, we first observe that \(h'(x) = 2x - k\sin(kx)\). Again treating \(k\) as a constant and differentiating, we find%
\begin{equation*}
h''(x) = 2 - k^2\cos(kx)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
We seek the values of \(x\) at which \(h''(x) = 0\) and \(h''\) changes sign. Setting \(h''(x) = 0\) and rearranging the resulting equation, we now seek \(x\) such that%
\begin{equation*}
k^2 \cos(kx) = 2\text{,}
\end{equation*}
or%
\begin{equation*}
\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Now, remember that \(k\) is an arbitrary positive constant and recall that \(-1 \le \cos(\theta) \le 1\) for all input values \(\theta\). If \(\frac{2}{k^2} \gt 1\), then the equation \(\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}\) has no solution. Hence, whenever \(k^2 \lt  2\), or \(k \lt  \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414\), it follows that the equation \(\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}\) has no solutions, which means that \(h''(x)\) is never zero (indeed, for these \(k\)-values, \(h''(x)\) is always positive so that \(h\) is always concave up). On the other hand, if \(k \ge \sqrt{2}\) then \(\frac{2}{k^2} \le 1\), which guarantees that \(\cos(kx) = \frac{2}{k^2}\) has infinitely many solutions due to the periodicity of the cosine function. At each such point, \(h''(x)\) changes sign if and only if \(k\gt\sqrt{2}\). (In the case where \(k=\sqrt2\), the function \(h''\) has infinitely many zeros but is always non-negative.) Therefore \(h\) has infinitely many inflection points whenever \(k \gt \sqrt{2}\), and no inflection points otherwise.%

To see why \(h\) can only have a finite number of critical numbers regardless of the value of \(k\), recall that \(h'(x) = 2x - k\sin(kx)\) and consider the equation%
\begin{equation*}
0 = h'(x)\text{,}
\end{equation*}
which then implies that \(2x = k\sin(kx)\). Since \(-1 \le \sin(kx) \le 1\), we know that \(-k \le k\sin(kx) \le k\). Once \(|x|\) is sufficiently large, we are guaranteed that \(|2x| \gt k\), which means that for large values of \(x\), the graphs of \(y=2x\) and \(y=k\sin(kx)\) cannot intersect. Moreover, for relatively small values of \(x\), the functions \(2x\) and \(k\sin(kx)\) can only intersect finitely many times since \(k\sin(kx)\) only oscillates a finite number of times on a finite interval. This is why \(h\) can only have a finite number of critical numbers, regardless of the value of \(k\).%

\item{}\hypertarget{p-2964}{}%
The critical numbers of a continuous function \(f\) are the values of \(p\) for which \(f'(p) = 0\) or \(f'(p)\) does not exist. These values are important because they identify horizontal tangent lines or corner points on the graph, which are the only possible locations at which a local maximum or local minimum can occur.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-2965}{}%
Given a differentiable function \(f\): whenever \(f'\) is positive, \(f\) is increasing; whenever \(f'\) is negative, \(f\) is decreasing. The first derivative test tells us that at any point where \(f\) changes from increasing to decreasing, \(f\) has a local maximum, while conversely at any point where \(f\) changes from decreasing to increasing \(f\) has a local minimum.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-2966}{}%
Given a twice differentiable function \(f\), if we have a horizontal tangent line at \(x = p\) and \(f''(p)\) is nonzero, the sign of \(f''\) tells us the concavity of \(f\) and hence whether \(f\) has a maximum or minimum at \(x = p\). In particular, if \(f'(p) = 0\) and \(f''(p) \lt 0\), then \(f\) is concave down at \(p\) and \(f\) has a local maximum there, while if \(f'(p) = 0\) and \(f''(p) \gt 0\), then \(f\) has a local minimum at \(p\). If both \(f'(p) = 0\) and \(f''(p) = 0\), then the second derivative test does not tell us whether \(f\) has a local extremum at \(p\) or not.%

From the given graph of \(f'\), the first derivative sign chart for \(f\) shows that \(f\) has critical numbers at \(x = -1, 1\) and that \(f'\) is positive for \(-1 \lt x lt 1\) and for \(x \gt 1\), while being negative for all \(x \lt -1\). Hence \(f\) is increasing for \(-1 \lt x lt 1\) and for \(x \gt 1\), and decreasing for \(x \lt -1\). It follows by the first derivative test that \(f\) has a local minimum at \(x = -1\) because \(f\) changes from decreasing to increasing there.%
\item\hypertarget{li-1945}{}\hypertarget{p-2983}{}%
Based on where \(f'(x)\) has horizontal tangent lines and where its slope is positive and negative, we can sketch an approximate graph of \(y = f''(x)\) in the usual way that we sketch the derivative of a given function. From the given graph of \(y = f'(x)\), we can see that \(f''(x) = 0\) at \(x \approx -0.35\) and at \(x = 1\), and that between these points, \(f''(x)\) is negative because \(f'(x)\) is decreasing, while \(f''(x)\) is positive everywhere else since \(f'(x)\) is increasing everywhere else. A possible graph of \(y = f''(x)\) is shown at right in the following figure.%
\item\hypertarget{li-1946}{}\hypertarget{p-2984}{}%
From our sketch of the second derivative in (b), we can develop a second derivative sign chart for \(f\). In particular, we saw that \(f''(x) = 0\) at \(x \approx -0.35\) and at \(x = 1\), and that between these points, \(f''(x)\) is negative, while \(f''(x)\) is positive everywhere else. This shows that \(f\) is concave down for \(-0.35 \lt x \lt 1\) while being concave up everywhere else. We thus see that \(f\) has points of inflection at both \(x \approx -0.35\) and \(x = 1\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-1947}{}\hypertarget{p-2985}{}%
Now that we know where \(f\) is increasing and decreasing as well as where \(f\) is concave up and concave down, along with the fact that \(f(0) = -0.5\), we can sketch an approximate graph of \(y = f(x)\). Note that we also know \(f\) has a horizontal tangent line at \(x = 1\) while being increasing on either side of \(x = 1\), and earlier we established that \(f\) has a local minimum at \(x = -1\). After making a few rough sketches and shifting the graph vertically to pass through \((0,-0.5)\), we arrive at the graph shown at left below.%

Given that \(h\) is decreasing for \(x \lt 0\) and increasing for \(x \gt 0\), the function \(h\) has an absolute minimum value at \(x=0\). So one root is to the left of this minimum and the other to the right. Thus, one root is negative and the other positive. See, for instance, the lowest of the three possibilities for \(h\) shown in the figure in (a).%
\item\hypertarget{li-1967}{}\hypertarget{p-3012}{}%
The slopes of the tangent lines to \(h\) will all be near \(3\), but less than \(3\), as \(x\) gets large. So the graph of \(h\) will look very much like a line with slope \(3\) for large values of \(x\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-1968}{}\hypertarget{p-3013}{}%
We note that \(h'\) is increasing everywhere, \(h\) is concave up everywhere. Since the graph of \(h'\) levels off for large values of \(|x|\), the concavity of \(h\) is small when \(|x|\) is large. Also, the largest value of the slope of the tangent line to \(h'\) occurs when \(x=0\), so \(h\) has its largest second dervitive when \(x=0\). So \(h\) is almost linear as \(x\) decreases without bound, \(h\) has more bend as \(x\) approaches \(0\), has its greatest bend at \(x=0\), then the second derivative of \(h\) as \(x\) increases, ultimately having \(h\) become almost linear as \(x\) increases without bound.%

To determine whether the tangent line lies above or below the graph of \(y=p(x)\) at \(x = 2\), we consider the concavity of \(p\). Recall we know that \(p''(2) = 0\) and that \(p\) is concave down to the left of \(x = 2\) and concave up to the right. Thus, the tangent line lies neither solely below nor solely above the graph of \(y = p(x)\) at \(x = 2\); it lies below \(y = p(x)\) to the right of \(x = 2\) and above \(y = p(x)\) to the left of \(x = 2\).%

What are the differences between finding relative extreme values and global extreme values of a function?%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3027}{}%
How is the process of finding the global maximum or minimum of a function over the function's entire domain different from determining the global maximum or minimum on a restricted domain?%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3028}{}%
For a function that is guaranteed to have both a global maximum and global minimum on a closed, bounded interval, what are the possible points at which these extreme values occur?%
\end{itemize}
\end{objectives}
\hypertarget{p-3029}{}%
We have seen that we can use the first derivative of a function to determine where the function is increasing or decreasing, and the second derivative to know where the function is concave up or concave down. This information helps us determine the overall shape and behavior of the graph as well as whether the function has relative extrema.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3030}{}%
Remember the difference between a relative maximum and a global maximum: there is a \emph{relative} maximum of \(f\) at \(x = p\) if \(f(p) \ge f(x)\) for all \(x\) \emph{near} \(p\), while there is a \emph{global} maximum at \(p\) if \(f(p) \ge f(x)\) for \emph{all} \(x\) in the domain of \(f\).%

\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-161}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-3054}{}%
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
\item\hypertarget{li-1999}{}\hypertarget{p-3055}{}%
We first notice that the domain of \(f\) is all real numbers, since the denominator of \(f(x)\) is always at least \(1\):%
\begin{align*}
(x+1)^2\ge\mathstrut\amp0\\
1+(x+1)^2\ge\mathstrut\amp1\text{.}
\end{align*}
To differentiate \(f\), we will first rewrite \(f(x)\) as%
\begin{equation*}
f(x)=2+3\left(1+(x+1)^2\right)^{-1}
\end{equation*}
and then use the chain rule to find%
\begin{align*}
f'(x)=\mathstrut\amp3\left((-1)\left(1+(x+1)^2\right)^{-2}\left(2(x+1)(1)\right)\right)\\
=\mathstrut\amp\frac{-6(x+1)}{\left(1+(x+1)^2\right)^2}\text{.}
\end{align*}
The denominator of \(f'(x)\) is always at least \(1\) for the same reason that the denominator of \(f(x)\) is always at least \(1\), so there are no points \(x=c\) for which \(f'(c)\) does not exist. Thus the only critical number(s) of \(f\) will occur when \(f'(c)=0\). This happens when%
\begin{align*}
-6(x+1)=\mathstrut\amp0\\
x+1=\mathstrut\amp0\\
x=\mathstrut\amp-1\text{.}
\end{align*}
Thus the only critical number of \(f\) is \(c=-1\), with \(f'(-1)=0\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2000}{}\hypertarget{p-3056}{}%
As stated in (a), the denominator of \(f'(x)\) is always at least \(1\), so in particular, it is always positive. On our first derivative sign chart, the only critical number we have is \(c=-1\), which splits the domain of \(f\) and \(f'\) into the intervals \((-\infty,-1)\) and \((-1,\infty)\). Thinking of the factors of \(f'(x)\) as \(-6\), \((x+1)\), and \(\frac{1}{\left(1+(x+1)^2\right)^2}\), the signs of these at \(x=-2\) are ``\(--+\)'', with the final product positive. Likewise, the signs of these factors at \(x=0\) are ``\(-++\)'', making the final product negative. Therefore \(f'(x)\gt0\) on the interval \(x\lt-1\), and \(f'(x)\lt0\) on the interval \(x\gt-1\). Hence \(f\) is increasing on \((-\infty,-1)\) and decreasing on \((-1,\infty)\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2001}{}\hypertarget{p-3057}{}%
According to the first derivative test, the point \((-1,f(-1))\) is a relative maximum of \(f\). Since this is the only critical point of the function and \(f\) is continuous everywhere, there is nowhere else that \(f\) can change direction. It follows that this point is actually a global maximum.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3058}{}%
From an algebraic standpoint, we have already observed that \(1+(x+1)^2\ge1\) for every value of \(x\). Consequently,%
\begin{equation*}
0\lt\frac{3}{1+(x+1)^2}\le3
\end{equation*}
for every value of \(x\), and this quotient achieves its maximum of \(3\) when \(x=-1\). Hence%
\begin{equation*}
2\lt2+\frac{3}{1+(x+1)^2}\le5
\end{equation*}
for every value of \(x\). Since \(f(-1)=5\), we conclude that the global maximum of \(f\) is \(5\) at \(x=-1\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2002}{}\hypertarget{p-3059}{}%
The symmetry of \(f\) about \(x=-1\) allows us to compute both limits simultaneously. We first note that \(\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\left(1+(x+1)^2\right)=\infty\) and \(\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\frac{1}{1+(x+1)^2}=0\). Thus%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}f(x)=\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\left(2+\frac{3}{1+(x+1)^2}\right)=2+0=2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
This tells us the graph of \(y=f(x)\) has a horizontal asymptote of \(y=2\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2003}{}\hypertarget{p-3060}{}%
In (c), we stated the inequality%
\begin{equation*}
2\lt2+\frac{3}{1+(x+1)^2}\le5\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Since the quotient in the formula for \(f(x)\) is always strictly greater than zero, adding \(2\) to the quotient to obtain \(f(x)\) will always yield a value strictly greater than \(2\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2004}{}\hypertarget{p-3061}{}%
Since \(f(x)\gt2\) for every value of \(x\), a global minimum of \(f\) (if it existed) would necessarily be larger than \(2\). But we showed in (d) that \(\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}f(x)=2\), meaning that \(f\) gets arbitrarily close to \(2\) as \(x\) gets large. Moreover, \(f'\) is always positive for \(x\lt-1\) and \(f'\) is always negative for \(x\gt-1\), so a lowest point of \(f\) is never attained.%

\hypertarget{p-3062}{}%
In both \hyperref[F-3-3-Intro]{Figure~\ref{F-3-3-Intro}} and \hyperref[PA-3-3]{Example~\ref{PA-3-3}} above, we were interested in finding the global minimum and global maximum for \(f\) on its entire domain. At other times, we might focus on some restriction of the domain.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3063}{}%
For example, rather than considering \(f(x) = 2 + \frac{3}{1+(x+1)^2}\) for every value of \(x\), perhaps instead we are only interested in those \(x\) for which \(0 \le x \le 4\), and we would like to know which values of \(x\) in the interval \([0,4]\) produce the largest possible and smallest possible values of \(f\). We are accustomed to critical numbers playing a key role in determining the location of extreme values of a function; now, by restricting the domain to an interval it makes sense that the endpoints of the interval will also be important to consider, as we see in the following example. When limiting ourselves to a particular interval, we will often refer to the \emph{absolute} maximum or minimum value, rather than the \emph{global} maximum or minimum.%

\hyperref[act-3-3-1]{Example~\ref{act-3-3-1}} showed how the absolute maximum and absolute minimum of a function on a closed, bounded interval \([a,b]\) depend not only on the critical numbers of the function, but also on the values of \(a\) and \(b\). In fact, the interval we choose has nearly the same influence on extreme values as the function under consideration. For instance, \hyperref[F-3-3-Interval]{Figure~\ref{F-3-3-Interval}} below depicts again the graph of \(y=g(x)\) that we looked at in \hyperref[act-3-3-1]{Example~\ref{act-3-3-1}}.%

\begin{assemblage}[The Extreme Value Theorem]\label{extreme-value-theorem}
\hypertarget{p-3091}{}%
\index{extreme value theorem} If \(f\) is a continuous function on a closed and bounded interval \([a,b]\), then \(f\) attains both an absolute minimum and absolute maximum on \([a,b]\). That is, there is some value \(x_m\) in \([a,b]\) such that \(f(x_m) \le f(x)\) for all \(x\) in \([a,b]\). Similarly, there is a value \(x_M\) in \([a,b]\) such that \(f(x_M) \ge f(x)\) for all \(x\) in \([a,b]\). Letting \(m = f(x_m)\) and \(M = f(x_M)\), it follows that \(m \le f(x) \le M\) for all \(x\) in \([a,b]\).%
\end{assemblage}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3092}{}%
The Extreme Value Theorem tells us that on any closed and bounded interval \([a,b]\), a continuous function has to achieve both an absolute minimum and an absolute maximum. The theorem does not tell us where these extreme values occur, only that they must exist. As we saw in \hyperref[act-3-3-1]{Example~\ref{act-3-3-1}}, the only possible locations for relative extrema are at the endpoints of the interval or at a critical number. It is important to consider only the critical numbers that lie within the interval.%

For \(h(x) = xe^{-x}\), we know that \(h'(x) = e^{-x}+xe^{-x}(-1) = e^{-x}(1-x)\). Therefore the only critical number of \(h\) is \(x = 1\). Next, we compute \(h(1)\), \(h(0)\), and \(h(3)\). Observe that %
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3120}{}%
\(h(0) = 0\)%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3121}{}%
\(h(1) = e^{-1} \approx 0.36788\)%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3122}{}%
\(h(3) = 3e^{-3} \approx 0.14936\)%
\end{itemize}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3123}{}%
Thus, on \([0,3]\), the absolute maximum of \(h\) is \(e^{-1}\) and the absolute minimum is \(0\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2053}{}\hypertarget{p-3124}{}%
Given \(p(t) = \sin(t) + \cos(t)\), it follows that \(p'(t) = \cos(t) - \sin(t)\), so \(p'(t) = 0\) implies that \(\cos(t) =\sin(t)\). The sine and cosine functions have the same value at \(\frac{\pi}{4} \pm k\pi\) for any integer \(k\). The only time this occurs in \([-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]\) is at \(x = \frac{\pi}{4}\), thus this is the only critical number of \(p\) in the given interval. Now %
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3125}{}%
\(p(-\frac{\pi}{2}) = \sin(-\frac{\pi}{2}) + \cos(-\frac{\pi}{2}) = -1 + 0 = -1\)%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3126}{}%
\(p(\frac{\pi}{4}) = \sin(\frac{\pi}{4}) + \cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.41421\)%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3127}{}%
\(p(\frac{\pi}{2}) = \sin(\frac{\pi}{2}) + \cos(\frac{\pi}{2}) = 1 + 0 = 1\)%
\end{itemize}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3128}{}%
Therefore, on \([-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}]\), the absolute maximum of \(p\) is \(\sqrt{2}\) and the absolute minimum is \(-1\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2057}{}\hypertarget{p-3129}{}%
With \(q(x) = \frac{x^2}{x-2}\), we have%
\begin{equation*}
q'(x) = \frac{2x(x-2) - x^2}{(x-2)^2} = \frac{x^2-4x}{(x-2)^2} = \frac{x(x-4)}{(x-2)^2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Hence the critical numbers of \(q\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 4\). Only the latter critical number lies in the interval \([3,7]\), and thus we evaluate \(q\) and find %
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3130}{}%
\(q(3) = \frac{9}{1} = 9\)%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3131}{}%
\(q(4) = \frac{16}{2} = 8\)%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3132}{}%
\(q(7) = \frac{49}{5} = 9.8\)%
\end{itemize}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3133}{}%
We now see that on \([3,7]\) the absolute maximum of \(q\) is \(9.8\) and the absolute minimum is \(8\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2061}{}\hypertarget{p-3134}{}%
We first observe that we are working on the domain of all real numbers rather than on a closed bounded interval. Hence the extreme value theorem does not apply and we need to think about the overall behavior of the function. First, since \(f(x) = 4 - e^{-(x-2)^2}\), we see by the chain rule that \(f'(x) = -e^{-(x-2)^2}(-2(x-2)) = 2(x-2)e^{-(x-2)^2}\). Since \(e^{-(x-2)^2}\) is always positive (and in particular is never zero), it follows that the only critical number of \(f\) is \(x = 2\). Furthermore, with \(f'(x) = 2(x-2)e^{-(x-2)^2}\), we see that \(f'(x) \lt 0\) for \(x \lt 2\), and \(f'(x) \gt 0\) for \(x \gt 2\). Thus \(f\) is decreasing for \(x \lt 2\) and increasing for \(x \gt 2\). The first derivative test then tells us that \(f\) has an absolute minimum at \(x = 2\) and \(f\) does not have an absolute maximum.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2062}{}\hypertarget{p-3135}{}%
This will be similar to part (a). We start by differentiating \(h\), finding \(h'(x)=e^{-ax}(1-ax)\). Thus the only critical number of \(h\) is \(\frac1a\), which is on the interval \(\left[0,\frac2a\right]\). Evaluating \(h\) at the interval endpoints and the critical number, we find %
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3136}{}%
\(h(0)=0\)%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3137}{}%
\(h\left(\frac1a\right)=\frac1ae^{-1}\approx\frac{0.368}a\gt0\)%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3138}{}%
\(h\left(\frac2a\right)=\frac2ae^{-2}\approx\frac{0.271}a\gt0\)%
\end{itemize}
 Thus on \(\left[0,\frac2a\right]\), the absolute maximum of \(h\) is \(\frac1ae^{-1}=(ae)^{-1}\) and the absolute minimum is \(0\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2066}{}\hypertarget{p-3139}{}%
This is similar to part (d), including the fact that we are looking at all real numbers and not a closed bounded domain. We first find that \(f'(x)=2(x-a)e^{-(x-a)^2}\) and the only critical number of \(f\) is \(x=a\). Since \(f'(x)\lt0\) for \(x\lt a\) and \(f'(x)\gt0\) for \(x\gt a\), the first derivative test tells us that \(f\) has a minimum at \(x=a\) but has no maximum. Finally, the value of the absolute minimum is \(f(a)=b-1\).%

\hypertarget{p-3140}{}%
We conclude this section with an example of an applied optimization problem. It highlights the role that a closed, bounded domain can play in finding absolute extrema.%
\begin{example}[]\label{Ex-3-3-1}
\hypertarget{p-3141}{}%
A 20 cm piece of wire is cut into two pieces. One piece is used to form a square and the other to form an equilateral triangle. How should the wire be cut to maximize the total area enclosed by the square and triangle? To minimize the area?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Hint.}\hypertarget{hint-82}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-3142}{}%
Drawing and labeling a picture to model the situation may be useful.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Answer.}\hypertarget{answer-137}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-3143}{}%
The area is maximized when the wire is uncut and all used for the square; the area is minimized when approximately \(11.3\) cm of wire are used for the triangle and approximately \(8.7\) cm are used for the square.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-164}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-3144}{}%
We begin by sketching a picture that illustrates the situation. The variable in the problem is where we decide to cut the wire, so we label the cut point at a distance \(x\) cm from one end of the wire and note that the remaining portion of the wire then has length \(20-x\) cm.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3145}{}%
\hyperref[F-3-3-Ex1]{Figure~\ref{F-3-3-Ex1}} below shows how the wire is used to form the two regular polygons. From the \(x\) cm segment of wire, we obtain an equilateral triangle with three sides of length \(\frac{x}{3}\); the square shaped from the remaining \(20-x\) cm of wire will have four sides of length \(\frac{20-x}{4}\).%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.56\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/3_3_Ex1.pdf}
\caption{A 20 cm piece of wire cut into two pieces, one of which forms an equilateral triangle while the other yields a square.\label{F-3-3-Ex1}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-3146}{}%
At this point, we note that there are obvious restrictions on \(x\): in particular, \(0 \le x \le 20\). In the extreme cases, all of the wire is being used to make just one figure. For instance, if \(x = 0\) then all 20 cm of wire are used to make a square that is \(5 \times 5\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3147}{}%
Now, our overall goal is to find the minimum and maximum areas that can be enclosed. Because the height \(h\) of an equilateral triangle is \(\sqrt{3}\) times half the length of the base \(b\), the area of the triangle is%
\begin{equation*}
A_{\Delta} = \frac{1}{2} bh = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{x}{3} \cdot \frac{x\sqrt{3}}{6}=\frac{\sqrt3x^2}{36}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
The area of the square is \(A_{\Box} = \left( \frac{20-x}{4} \right)^2\). Therefore, the total area function is%
\begin{equation*}
A(x) = \frac{\sqrt{3}x^2}{36} + \left( \frac{20-x}{4} \right)^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3148}{}%
Remember that we are considering this function only on the restricted domain \([0,20]\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3149}{}%
Differentiating \(A(x)\), we have%
\begin{equation*}
A'(x) = \frac{\sqrt{3}x}{18} + 2\left( \frac{20-x}{4} \right)\left( -\frac{1}{4} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{18} x + \frac{1}{8}x - \frac{5}{2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3150}{}%
When we set \(A'(x) = 0\), we find that \(x = \frac{180}{4\sqrt{3}+9} \approx 11.3007\) is the only critical number of \(A\) in the interval \([0,20]\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3151}{}%
Evaluating \(A\) at the critical number and endpoints, we see that \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3152}{}%
\(A(0) = 25\) cm\(^2\)%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3153}{}%
\(A\left(\frac{180}{4\sqrt{3}+9}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}\left(\frac{180}{4\sqrt{3}+9}\right)^2}{4} + \left( \frac{20-\frac{180}{4\sqrt{3}+9}}{4} \right)^2 \approx 10.8741\) cm\(^2\)%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3154}{}%
\(A(20) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{36}(400) = \frac{100}{9} \sqrt{3} \approx 19.2450\) cm\(^2\)%
\end{itemize}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3155}{}%
Thus, the absolute minimum occurs when \(x \approx 11.3007\) cm and results in the minimum area of approximately \(10.8741\) square centimeters. The absolute maximum occurs when we invest all of the wire in the square (and none in the triangle), resulting in 25 square centimeters of area. These results are confirmed by a plot of \(y = A(x)\) on the interval \([0,20]\), as shown below in \hyperref[F-3-3-Ex1Plot]{Figure~\ref{F-3-3-Ex1Plot}}.%

After cutting out the four \(x\times x\) squares from the corners of the cardboard and folding up the edges, the resulting box is \(x\) inches tall, \(10-2x\) inches wide, and \(15-2x\) inches long. Thus the volume of the box (in cubic inches) is given by%
\begin{equation*}
V(x) = x (10-2x) (15-2x) = 4x^3 - 50x^2 + 150x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-2093}{}\hypertarget{p-3182}{}%
At first glance, we see that \(V\) is a polynomial and so is defined for every real number \(x\). However, because \(x\) represents a length in this problem, the smallest \(x\) can be is \(0\). Moreover, since the shortest side of the cardboard is initially only \(10\) inches and cutting the squares reduces each side by \(2x\) inches, the largest \(x\) can be is \(5\). We note that both of these extremes would result in a ``box'' with zero volume, as the first would have no height and the second would have no width. Finally, the problem says the height needs to be between \(1\) and \(3\) inches, so we will further restrict the domain of \(V\) to \(1 \le x \le 3\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2094}{}\hypertarget{p-3183}{}%
Since \(V'(x) = 12x^2 - 100x + 150\), it follows that the critical numbers (where \(V'(x) = 0\)) are%
\begin{equation*}
x = \frac{25 \pm 5\sqrt{7}}{6} \approx 6.371, 1.962\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-2095}{}\hypertarget{p-3184}{}%
Only the latter critical number is in the relevant domain of \(V\), so we consider %

\(V(1) = 104\) in\(^3\),%

\(V(3) = 108\) in\(^3\).%
\end{itemize}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-2099}{}\hypertarget{p-3188}{}%
The maximum possible volume of the box is about \(132.038\) cubic inches, occurring when squares with side length around \(1.962\) inches are cut from each corner of the cardboard. The minimum possible volume of the box is \(104\) in\(^3\) and occurs with a box that is \(1\) inch tall.%

\hyperref[Ex-3-3-1]{Example~\ref{Ex-3-3-1}} and \hyperref[act-3-3-3]{Example~\ref{act-3-3-3}} illustrate standard steps that we undertake in almost every applied optimization problem: we draw a picture to demonstrate the situation, introduce one or more variables to represent quantities that are changing, find a function that models the quantity to be optimized, and then decide on an appropriate domain for that function. Once that is done, we are in the familiar situation of finding the absolute minimum and maximum of a function over a particular domain, so we apply the calculus ideas that we have been studying up to this point in \hyperref[C-3]{Chapter~\ref{C-3}}.%

To find relative extreme values of a function, we use a first derivative sign chart and classify all of the function's critical numbers. If instead we are interested in absolute extreme values, we first decide whether we are considering the entire domain of the function or a particular interval.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3192}{}%
In the case of finding global extrema over the function's entire domain, we again use a first or second derivative sign chart. If we are working to find absolute extrema on a restricted interval, then we first identify all critical numbers of the function that lie in the interval.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3193}{}%
For a continuous function on a closed, bounded interval, the only possible points at which absolute extreme values occur are the critical numbers and the endpoints. Hence we evaluate the function at each endpoint and at each critical number in the interval and then compare the results to decide which is largest (the absolute maximum) and which is smallest (the absolute minimum).%

It's not possible to say without more information: for instance, the functions \(f(x) = e^{-x}\), \(f(x) = e^{-x}\), and \(f(x) = x^2\) are each always concave up, but only one of them has a global minimum. We can say for sure that by being always concave up, \(f\) cannot have a global maximum, and it also cannot have both a global maximum and a global minimum. It might have a global minimum, or it might have neither.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2112}{}\hypertarget{p-3206}{}%
By being twice differentiable, we know that \(g'(x) = 0\) any time \(x\) is a critical number of \(g\). Thus, given the signs of \(g'(x)\) on the stated intervals, \(g\) is decreasing before \(x = a\) and decreasing on \(a \lt x \lt b\), with a horizontal tangent line at \(x = a\). In addition, \(g\) is increasing for \(x \gt b\). Thus, we know that \(g\) has a global minimum at \(x = a\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2113}{}\hypertarget{p-3207}{}%
Since \(h\) is always decreasing for \(x \lt a\), always increasing for \(a \lt x \lt b\), and always decreasing for \(x \gt b\), we know that \(h\) has a local minimum at \(x = a\) and a local maximum at \(x = b\). Moreover, these local extrema are both global extrema since \(h(x) to 0\) as \(x \to \pm \infty\). In particular, since \(h(x)\) decreases to \(0\) for \(x \gt b\) and increases on \(a \lt x \lt b\), it follows that \(h(b)\) is the largest value of \(h(x)\) on \((a, \infty)\), and that \(h(b) \gt 0\). Similarly, since \(h(x)\) decreases on \((-\infty,
a)\) and approaches \(0\) as \(x \to -\infty\), and \(h(x)\) increases on \(a \lt x \lt b\), it must be the case that \(h(a)\) is the least value of \(h(x)\) on \((-\infty,
b)\) and that \(h(b) \lt 0\). Hence, \(h(x)\) is always negative on \(x \lt a\) and \(h(x)\) is always positive on \(x \gt b\). From all of these observations, it follows that \(h\) has a global minimum at \(x = a\) and a global maximum at \(x = b\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2114}{}\hypertarget{p-3208}{}%
First, observe that \(p\) is defined for all real numbers by assumption, so \(p(a)\) has some finite value. However, \(p\) is not differentiable at \(x = a\) and \(p\) is concave up to the left of \(x = a\) and concave down to the right of \(x = a\). This indicates that \(p\) has a relative maximum at \(x = a\). Not enough information is provided, however, to determine if this relative maximum is a global maximum, nor if \(p\) happens to have a global minimum at some other point.%

Given \(p(x) = x^3 - a^2x\) on \([0,a]\), we first find the critical number(s) of \(p\) that lie in \([0,a]\). Since \(p'(x) = 3x^2 - a^2 = 3\left(x^2 - \frac{a^2}{3} \right)\), we know \(p\) has critical numbers at \(x = \pm \frac{a}{\sqrt{3}}\). The negative critical number lies outside the interval, while the positive one lies within the interval since \(0 \lt \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \lt 1\). Evaluating \(p\) at the endpoints and the critical number within the interval, we find that \(p(0) = 0\), \(p(a) = a^3 - a^2 \cdot a = 0\), and \(p\left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{3}} \right) = \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^3 - a^2 \cdot \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{3}} \right) = \frac{a^3}{3\sqrt{3}} - \frac{a^3}{\sqrt{3}} = -\frac{2a^3}{3\sqrt{3}}\). Hence, the global maximum of \(p\) on \([0,a]\) is \(p(0) = p(a) = 0\) and the global minimum is \(p\left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{3}} \right) = -\frac{2a^3}{3\sqrt{3}}\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2124}{}\hypertarget{p-3221}{}%
Given \(r(x) = axe^{-bx}\) on \(\left[\frac{1}{2b}, \frac{2}{b}\right]\), we first find the critical numbers of \(r\) that lie in the given interval. Note that by the product rule, \(r'(x) = ax e^{-bx} (-b) + e^{-bx} a\). Factoring, \(r'(x) = ae^{-bx}(-bx + 1)\), and thus the only critical number of \(r\) occurs where \(x = \frac{1}{b}\). Note that \(\frac{1}{2b} \lt \frac{1}{b} \lt b\) since \(b \gt 1\), and thus the critical number lies within the interval.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3222}{}%
Evaluating \(r\) at the endpoints and the critical number, we find %
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3223}{}%
\(r\left( \frac{1}{2b} \right) = a \cdot \frac{1}{2b} \cdot e^{-1/2} \approx 0.607 \frac{a}{2b} = 0.3035 \frac{a}{b}\)%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3224}{}%
\(r\left( \frac{2}{b} \right) = a \cdot \frac{2}{b} \cdot e^{-2} \approx 0.135 \frac{2a}{b} = 0.270 \frac{a}{b}\)%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3225}{}%
\(r\left( \frac{1}{b} \right) = a \cdot \frac{1}{b} \cdot e^{-1} \approx 0.368 \frac{a}{b} \)%
\end{itemize}
 The global max of \(r\) is therefore \(r\left( \frac{1}{b} \right) \approx 0.368 \frac{a}{b}\) and the global min is \(r\left( \frac{2}{b} \right) \approx 0.270 \frac{a}{b}\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2128}{}\hypertarget{p-3226}{}%
For \(w(x) = a(1-e^{-bx})\) on \([b, 3b]\), we first note that \(w'(x) = a(be^{-bx}) = abe^{-bx}\). Since \(a\) and \(b\) are both positive and so is \(e^{-bx}\) for every value of \(x\), we see that \(w'(x) \gt 0\) for every value of \(x\). Because \(w\) is always increasing (specifically on \([b,3b]\)), \(w\) has its global minimum at the left endpoint (\(g(b) = a(1-e^{-b^2})\)) and its global maximum at the right endpoint (\(g(3b) = a(1-e^{-3b^2})\)).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2129}{}\hypertarget{p-3227}{}%
Finally, for \(s(x) = \sin(kx)\) on \(\left[\frac{\pi}{3k}, \frac{5\pi}{6k}\right]\), we know \(s'(x) = k\cos(kx)\), and \(\cos(kx) = 0\) when \(kx = \frac{\pi}{2} \pm n\pi\) for some integer \(n\), so \(x = \frac{\pi}{2k} \pm n\pi = \frac{\pi \pm 2n\pi}{2k}\). These \(x\)-values are the critical numbers of \(s\). Note that when \(n = -1, 0, 1\), the corresponding critical numbers are%
\begin{equation*}
x = -\frac{\pi}{2k}, \frac{\pi}{2k}, \frac{3\pi}{2k}
\end{equation*}
Comparing the values of \(-\frac{\pi}{2}\), \(\frac{\pi}{2k}\), and \(\frac{3\pi}{2k}\) to \(\frac{\pi}{3}\) and \(\frac{5\pi}{6}\), we see that only \(\frac{\pi}{2k}\) lies in the given interval \(\left[\frac{\pi}{3k}, \frac{5\pi}{6k}\right]\), and thus \(x = \frac{\pi}{2k}\) is the only critical number at which we need to evaluate \(s\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3228}{}%
Evaluating \(s\) at the endpoints and relevant critical number, we find: %
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3229}{}%
\(s\left( \frac{\pi}{3k} \right) = \sin\left( k \cdot \frac{\pi}{3k} \right) = \sin\left( \frac{\pi}{3} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\);%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3230}{}%
\(s\left( \frac{5\pi}{6k} \right) = \sin\left( k \cdot \frac{5\pi}{6k} \right) = \sin\left( \frac{5\pi}{6} \right) = \frac{1}{2}\); and%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3231}{}%
\(s\left( \frac{\pi}{2k} \right) = \sin\left( k \cdot \frac{\pi}{2k} \right) = \sin\left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1\).%
\end{itemize}
 Hence the global max of \(s\) on \(\left[\frac{\pi}{3k}, \frac{5\pi}{6k}\right]\) is \(s\left( \frac{\pi}{2k} \right) = 1\) and the global min of \(s\) is \(s\left( \frac{5\pi}{6k} \right) = \frac{1}{2}\).%

The fact that \(f'(x) \leq 0\) for all \(x\) in \([a,b]\) means that \(f\) cannot increase in this interval. So either \(f\) is constant or \(f\) decreases somewhere in this interval. We can conclude that the global maximum value of \(f\) occurs at \(x=a\) and the global minimum value at \(x=b\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2142}{}\hypertarget{p-3244}{}%
The information we are given shows that \(g\) is increasing on \((a,c)\) and decreasing on \((c,b)\). So \(g\) has a global maximum value at \(x=c\). We know that \(g\) must have a global minimum at either \(x=a\) or \(x=b\). The information given does not tell us how much \(g\) increases on \((a,c)\) and decreases on \((c,b)\), so we cannot determine the endpoint at which \(g\) attains its global minimum value.%

In order for \(h(a)=h(b)\) and \(h''(x) \lt 0\) for all \(x\) in \([a,b]\), the graph of \(h\) must look something like a parabola that opens down on the interval \([a,b]\). Consequently, \(h\) has its global minimum at \(x=a\) and \(x=b\), and its global maximum somewhere in \((a,b)\), but we do not know the exact point at which \(h\) attains its global maximum.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2144}{}\hypertarget{p-3246}{}%
The given information forces the graph of \(p\) to decrease on \((a,c)\) then increase on \((c,b)\). Thus, we must have \(p(c) \lt p(b)\) and so \(p\) has its global minimum value at \(x=c\). Since \(p(a) \gt p(b)\), this makes \(p(a)\) the global maximum value of \(p\) on \([a,b]\).%

For \(s(t) = 3\sin(2(t-\frac{\pi}{6})) + 5\), \(s'(t) = 3\cos(2(t-\frac{\pi}{6})) \cdot 2 = 6\cos(2(t-\frac{\pi}{6}))\). It follows that \(s'(t) = 0\) if and only if \(\cos(2(t-\frac{\pi}{6})) = 0\), and thus \(2(t-\frac{\pi}{6}) = \frac{\pi}{2} \pm k\pi\) for some integer value of \(k\). Solving this most recent equation for \(t\), we have \(t-\frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{\pi}{4} \pm \frac{k\pi}{2}\), so%
\begin{equation*}
t = \frac{\pi}{6} + \frac{\pi}{4} \pm \frac{k\pi}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{12} \pm \frac{k\pi}{2}\text{.}

Now we consider the given interval \([\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{7\pi}{6}]\), which we can think of as \([\frac{2\pi}{12}, \frac{14\pi}{12}]\). The value \(t = \frac{5\pi}{12}\) lies in this interval, as does \(t = \frac{5\pi}{12} + \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{11\pi}{12}\). Thus, we have two critical numbers in the interval at which to evaluate \(s\), as well as at the endpoints.%

 The global max of \(s\) on \([0, \frac{\pi}{2}]\) is thus \(s(\frac{5\pi}{12}) = 8\), while the global min is \(s(0) = 5 - \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 2.402\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2162}{}\hypertarget{p-3269}{}%
On the interval from \(t = 0\) to \(t = 2\pi\), \(s\) completes nearly two full periods, and thus achieves each of its maximum and minimum values. The global maximum is \(8\) as determined in (a), and the global minimum is \(2\). These occur, for example, at \(s(\frac{5\pi}{12}) = 8\), while the global min is \(s(\frac{11\pi}{12}) = 2\). There are other points at which the function achieves these values on the given interval.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2163}{}\hypertarget{p-3270}{}%
On the interval \([\frac{\pi}{3}, \frac{5\pi}{6}] = [\frac{4\pi}{12}, \frac{10\pi}{12}]\), only the critical number \(t = \frac{5\pi}{12}\) lies in the interval. Thus we have three values at which to evaluate \(s\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3271}{}%
Doing so: %
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3272}{}%
\(s(\frac{5\pi}{12}) = 8\);%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3273}{}%
\(s(\frac{\pi}{3}) = 3\sin(2(\frac{\pi}{3}-\frac{\pi}{6})) + 5 = 3\sin(\frac{\pi}{6}) + 5 = \frac{3}{2} + 5 = \frac{13}{2} = 6.5\); and%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3274}{}%
\(s(\frac{5\pi}{6}) = 3\sin(2(\frac{5\pi}{6}-\frac{\pi}{6})) + 5 = 3\sin(\frac{2\pi}{3}) + 5 = 5 + \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 7.598\).%
\end{itemize}
 The global max of \(s\) on \([\frac{\pi}{3}, \frac{5\pi}{6}]\) is thus \(s(\frac{5\pi}{12}) = 8\), while the global min is \(s(\frac{\pi}{3}) = 6.5\).%

%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3275}{}%
In a setting where a situation is described for which optimal parameters are sought, how do we develop a function that models the situation and then use calculus to find the desired maximum or minimum?%
\end{itemize}
\end{objectives}
\hypertarget{p-3276}{}%
Near the conclusion of \hyperref[sec-3-3-optimization]{Section~\ref{sec-3-3-optimization}}, we considered two optimization problems in which determining the function to be optimized was part of the problem. \hyperref[Ex-3-3-1]{Example~\ref{Ex-3-3-1}} sought to maximize the total area enclosed by the combination of an equilateral triangle and a square built from a single piece of wire (cut in two). \hyperref[act-3-3-3]{Example~\ref{act-3-3-3}} subsequently investigated how the volume of a box constructed by removing squares from the corners of a piece of cardboard is dependent on the size of the squares removed.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3277}{}%
Neither of these problems explicitly provided a function to optimize. Instead, we first tried to understand the problem by drawing a figure and introducing variables, and then sought to develop a formula for a function that modeled the quantity to be optimized. Upon establishing a function, we chose an appropriate domain and then were finally ready to apply the ideas of calculus to determine the absolute minimum or maximum.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3278}{}%
In this section the primary emphasis is on the reader solving problems. Initially, some substantial guidance is provided, but the problems progress to require greater independence as we move along.%
\begin{example}[]\label{PA-3-4}
\hypertarget{p-3279}{}%
According to U.S.~postal regulations, the girth plus the length of a parcel sent by mail may not exceed 108 inches, where by ``girth'' we mean the perimeter of the smallest end. What is the largest possible volume of a rectangular parcel with a square end that can be sent by mail? What are the dimensions of such a package? The process of answering these questions has been broken up into a sequence of tasks:%

\item\hypertarget{li-2170}{}\hypertarget{p-3283}{}%
The problem statement tells us that the parcel's girth plus length may not exceed 108 inches. In order to maximize volume, we assume that we will actually need the girth plus length to equal 108 inches. What equation does this produce involving \(x\) and \(y\)?%
\item\hypertarget{li-2171}{}\hypertarget{p-3284}{}%
Solve the equation you found in (c) for one of \(x\) or \(y\) (whichever is easier).%

\item\hypertarget{li-2173}{}\hypertarget{p-3286}{}%
Over what domain should we consider this function? Note that both \(x\) and \(y\) must be positive; how does the constraint that girth plus length is 108 inches produce intervals of possible values for \(x\) and \(y\)?%

Since the problem says \(y\) is the length of the \emph{longer} side, we assume \(x\le y\) and that the square end is smallest. However, we recognize that this may not end up being the case, and if necessary are prepared to rework the problem with the square end as the largest side. \begin{figure}

\end{figure}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-2190}{}\hypertarget{p-3306}{}%
We are asked to maximize the volume of the box. Since the box has a square end with side length \(x\) inches and is \(y\) inches long, the volume formula is%
\begin{equation*}
V=x^2y\text{,}
\end{equation*}
measured in cubic inches.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2191}{}\hypertarget{p-3307}{}%
We are working under the assumption that the square end is the smallest end, which means the perimeter of the square face will be the girth and the other side will be the length. This yields the relation%
\begin{equation*}
4x+y=108\text{.}
\end{equation*}
We note again that we have the assumed constraint \(x\le y\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2192}{}\hypertarget{p-3308}{}%
Since \(4x+y=108\), we can say that \(y=108-4x\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2193}{}\hypertarget{p-3309}{}%
Since \(V=x^2y\) and \(y=108-4x\), an alternate expression for the parcel's volume is%
\begin{equation*}
V(x)=x^2(108-4x)=108x^2-4x^3\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-2194}{}\hypertarget{p-3310}{}%
We know that \(x\) and \(y\) must both be positive, so we have \(0\lt x,y\). Additionally, because the girth is given by \(4x\) rather than by \(2x+2y\) (the perimeter of the other sides), we can say that \(x\le y\). Finally, since \(4x+y=108\) and \(x\le y\), it must be the case that \(5x\le4x+y=108\), so \(x\le 108/5=21.6\). Likewise, since \(x\) is positive, we must have \(y\lt 108\). In sum, we have the intervals:%
\begin{equation*}
0\lt x\le21.6 \text{ and }x\le y\lt108\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-2195}{}\hypertarget{p-3311}{}%
We now need to maximize the function \(V(x)=108x^2-4x^3\) on the interval \((0,21.6]\). We begin by differentiating \(V\), finding%
\begin{equation*}
V'(x)=216x-12x^2=12x(18-x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
As \(V'(x)\) is a polynomial, it is defined everywhere; to find the critical numbers of \(V\), then, we need only solve the equation \(V'(x)=0\). Doing so yields the critical numbers \(x=0\) and \(x=18\). On the interval \(0\lt x\le21.6\), the only critical number is \(18\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3312}{}%
Testing to check that this is a maximum, the first derivative test says \(V'(x)\gt0\) for \(0\lt x\lt 18\) and \(V'(x)\lt0\) for \(18\lt x\). Thus \(V(18)\) is a relative maximum and, on the interval \((0,21.6]\) (or more generally, the interval \((0,\infty)\)), an absolute maximum. Further supporting this conclusion is the second derivative test, where \(V''(x)=216-24x\) is zero only when \(x=9\), and \(V''(18)\lt0\), showing that \(V\) is concave down on (at least) the interval \((9,21.6)\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3313}{}%
We have firmly established that the maximum volume occurs when \(x=18\). This coincides with the length \(y=108-4(18)=36\) and the volume \(V=(18)^2(36)=11,664\). Therefore the maximum volume of a parcel with a square end (provided that end is the smallest end of the box\footnote{It turns out that when we assume the square end is the larger end, we end up with the dimensions \(24\times24\times18\) and a volume of \(10,368\text{ in}^3\), so our process did indeed find the maximum volume of a parcel with a square end.\label{fn-30}}) subject to the dimension constraints of the USPS is \(11,664\) cubic inches. This volume is achieved when the package is \(18\) inches by \(18\) inches by \(36\) inches.%

\subsection[{More Applied Optimization Problems}]{More Applied Optimization Problems}\label{subsection-89}
\hypertarget{p-3314}{}%
Many of the steps in \hyperref[PA-3-4]{Example~\ref{PA-3-4}} are ones that we will execute in any applied optimization problem. We briefly summarize those steps here to provide an overview of our approach in subsequent questions:%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3315}{}%
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-2196}{}\hypertarget{p-3316}{}%
\emph{Draw a picture and introduce variables.}%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3317}{}%
It is essential to first understand what quantities are allowed to vary in the problem and then to represent those values with variables. Drawing a picture with these variables labeled is a particularly helpful way to accomplish this; in some cases, drawing several pictures might be useful. A nice example of this can be seen at \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/99}{http://gvsu.edu/s/99}, where the choice of where to bend a piece of wire into the shape of a rectangle determines both the rectangle's shape and area.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2197}{}\hypertarget{p-3318}{}%
\emph{Identify the quantity to be optimized as well as any key relationships among the variable quantities.}%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3319}{}%
Essentially this step involves writing equations that involve the variables that have been introduced: one equation will represent the quantity whose minimum or maximum is sought; there may be additional equations showing how multiple variables in the problem are interrelated.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2198}{}\hypertarget{p-3320}{}%
\emph{Determine a function of a single variable that models the quantity to be optimized.}%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3321}{}%
It may be necessary to eliminate one or more variables in the function formula using the secondary equations that were found in the previous step. For example, in \hyperref[PA-3-4]{Example~\ref{PA-3-4}} we initially found that \(V = x^2 y\); the additional relationship that \(4x + y = 108\) allowed us to substitute \(108-4x\) for \(y\) in the volume equation, thus expressing the volume as a function of the single variable \(x\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2199}{}\hypertarget{p-3322}{}%
\emph{Decide the domain on which to consider the function being optimized.}%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3323}{}%
Often the physical constraints of the problem will limit the possible values that the independent variable can take on. Thinking back to the picture that describes the overall situation and any relationships among variables in the problem often helps identify the smallest and largest values of the input variable.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2200}{}\hypertarget{p-3324}{}%
\emph{Use calculus to identify the absolute maximum and/or minimum of the quantity being optimized.}%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3325}{}%
This always involves finding the critical numbers of the function first. Then depending on the domain, we either construct a first derivative sign chart (for an open or unbounded interval) or evaluate the function at the endpoints and critical numbers (for a closed, bounded interval).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2201}{}\hypertarget{p-3326}{}%
\emph{Finally, we make certain we have answered the question that was posed.}%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3327}{}%
Does the question seek the absolute maximum of a quantity, or do we need the values of the variables that produce the maximum? In other words, finding the maximum volume of a parcel is different from finding the dimensions of the parcel that yield that volume.%
\end{enumerate}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3328}{}%
The remaining examples involve a variety of quantities to be optimized. Each task presents an opportunity to practice the above steps, possibly with some adaptations to suit the context of the problem.%

Let the can have radius \(r\) and height \(h\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2211}{}\hypertarget{p-3341}{}%
The volume is \(V = \pi r^2 h\); the surface area is \(S = 2 \pi r^2 + 2 \pi r h\); the total cost is \(C = 2 \pi r^2 \cdot 0.027 + 2 \pi r h \cdot 0.015\).%

The minimizing radius is \(r = \sqrt[3]{ \frac{0.48}{0.108 \pi} } \approx 1.123\) inches; the minimizing height is \(h \approx 4.041\) inches; the minimum cost is \(C(1.12259) \approx \$0.642\).%

\hypertarget{p-3344}{}%
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-2214}{}\hypertarget{p-3345}{}%
We let \(r\) be the radius of the base of the cylindrical can and \(h\) be its height.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2215}{}\hypertarget{p-3346}{}%
The volume of a cylinder is the area of the base times the height, so \(V = \pi r^2 h\). Surface area is the area of the lids plus the area of the ``side''; we can think of the side as a rectangle (if we were to cut it and unroll it) with height \(h\) and width \(2\pi r\), the perimeter of the base. Hence the surface area of the can is%
\begin{equation*}
S = 2 \pi r^2 + 2 \pi r h\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Finally, the total cost (in dollars) is the cost of the lids plus the cost of the sides, which is%
\begin{equation*}
C = 2 \pi r^2 \cdot 0.027 + 2 \pi r h \cdot 0.015\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-2216}{}\hypertarget{p-3347}{}%
Because the volume is fixed at 16 cubic inches, we know that \(16 =  \pi r^2 h\). Choosing to solve for \(h\), we find that \(h = \frac{16}{\pi r^2}\). We can then substitute this expression into the total cost formula in place of \(h\), yielding%
\begin{align*}
C(r) =\mathstrut\amp 2 \pi r^2 \cdot 0.027 + 2 \pi r \left( \frac{16}{\pi r^2} \right) \cdot 0.015\\
=\mathstrut\amp 0.054 \pi r^2 + \frac{0.48}{r}\text{.}
\end{align*}
We note that the only constraint on \(r\) is that \(r \gt 0\), hence this is the domain on which we seek to minimize \(C\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2217}{}\hypertarget{p-3348}{}%
To differentiate the cost function, we first recall that \(\frac1r=r^{-1}\) and then find%
\begin{align*}
C'(r)=\mathstrut\amp 0.108\pi r-0.48r^{-2}\\
=\mathstrut\amp 0.108 \pi r - \frac{0.48}{r^2}\text{.}
\end{align*}
Note that \(C'(r)\) is undefined at \(r=0\), but this point is not in the domain of \(C\),\footnote{Here, we mean both that \(C(0)\) is undefined and that contextually we require \(r\gt0\) as discussed in (c). Because \(C(0)\) is undefined, \(0\) is not a true critical number of \(C\); however, it is still a value at which the sign of \(C'\) can change, and we can only disregard it here because the contextual supposition that \(r\gt0\) stipulates that we need only find critical numbers on the interval \((0,\infty)\).\label{fn-31}} so we only need to consider critical numbers at which the derivative is zero. Hence we set \(C'(r) = 0\) and solve for \(r\), finding that%
\begin{equation*}
0.108 \pi r = \frac{0.48}{r^2}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
so that \(r^3 = \frac{0.48}{0.108 \pi} \approx 1.415\), from which it follows that \(r = \sqrt[3]{ \frac{0.48}{0.108 \pi} } \approx 1.123\) is the only critical number of \(C\). At this point we can use either the first or second derivative test to justify that \(C\) has an absolute minimum at \(r = \sqrt[3]{ \frac{0.48}{0.108 \pi} }\). We choose to use the second derivative test; note that \(C''(r) = 0.108 \pi + 0.96 \frac{1}{r^3}\), which is always positive for \(r \gt 0\). Thus \(C\) is always concave up on the relevant domain (\(r \gt 0\)), and consequently \(r = \sqrt[3]{ \frac{0.48}{0.108 \pi} } \approx 1.123\) is where the absolute minimum of \(C\) occurs. In addition, we note that since \(h = \frac{16}{\pi r^2}\), the corresponding \(h\) value is \(h \approx 4.041\), and the overall minimum value is \(C\left(\sqrt[3]{ \frac{0.48}{0.108 \pi} }\right) \approx 0.641\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3349}{}%
Thus a can with radius approximately \(1.123\) inches and height approximately \(4.041\) inches will be cheapest among all cans with a volume of \(16\) cubic inches. The cost of constructing a can with these dimensions is about \(\$0.641\), or roughly \(64\) cents.%

Familiarity with common geometric formulas is particularly helpful in problems such as the one in \hyperref[act-3-4-1]{Example~\ref{act-3-4-1}}. Sometimes those involve perimeter, area, volume, or surface area. At other times, the constraints of a problem introduce right triangles (where the Pythagorean Theorem applies) or other functions whose formulas provide relationships among the variables.%
\begin{example}[]\label{act-3-4-2}
\hypertarget{p-3351}{}%
A hiker starting at a point \(P\) on a straight road walks east towards point \(Q\), which is on the road and three kilometers from point \(P\).    Two kilometers due north of point \(Q\) is a cabin. The hiker will walk down the road for a while, at a pace of \(8\) kilometers per hour. At some point \(Z\) between \(P\) and \(Q\), the hiker leaves the road and makes a straight line towards the cabin through the woods, hiking at a pace of \(3\) kph, as pictured below in \hyperref[F-3-4-Act2]{Figure~\ref{F-3-4-Act2}}. In order to minimize the time to go from \(P\) to \(Z\) to the cabin, where should the hiker turn into the forest?%

\noindent\textbf{Hint.}\hypertarget{hint-86}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-3352}{}%
Let \(x\) be the distance from \(Z\) to \(Q\). What is the distance from \(P\) to \(Z\) in terms of \(x\)? How about the distance from \(Z\) to the cabin? How does time depend on distance and walking speed?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Answer.}\hypertarget{answer-145}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-3353}{}%
The absolute minimum time the hiker can achieve is about \(0.993\) hours, which is attained by hiking about \(2.2\) km from \(P\) towards \(Q\) and then turning into the woods for the remainder of the trip.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-172}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-3354}{}%
We begin by letting \(x\) be the distance from \(Z\) to \(Q\). Since it is \(3\) km from \(P\) to \(Q\), the distance from \(P\) to \(Z\) is \(3-x\) km. Furthermore, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find that the distance from \(Z\) to the cabin is \(\sqrt{4+x^2}\) km.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3355}{}%
Next we want to determine the hiker's time as a function of \(x\). Because distance equals rate times time, it follows that time is distance divided by rate. The hiker travels along the road for \(3-x\) km at a pace of \(8\) km/hr, thus her time on the road is%
\begin{equation*}
T_r = \frac{3-x}{8} \text{ hr}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3356}{}%
Once she enters the woods, her pace drops to \(3\) km/hr and she continues for \(\sqrt{4+x^2}\) km before reaching the cabin. She spends a total of%
\begin{equation*}
T_w = \frac{\sqrt{4+x^2}}{3}
\end{equation*}
hours hiking in the woods.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3357}{}%
Altogether, the time it takes the hiker to reach the cabin is given by the function%
\begin{equation*}
T(x) = \frac{3-x}{8} + \frac{\sqrt{4+x^2}}{3}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3358}{}%
Because the only values of \(x\) that make sense to use are \(0 \le x \le 3\) (since walking away from or past \(Q\) before turning to the cabin both add unnecessary time to the trip),  we use this domain for \(T\) and now seek the absolute minimum of \(T\) on \([0,3]\). We find that%
\begin{equation*}
T'(x) = -\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left(4+x^2\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} (2x) = -\frac{1}{8} + \frac{x}{3\sqrt{4+x^2}}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3359}{}%
Note that since \(4+x^2\ge2\) for every value of \(x\), \(T'\) is defined everywhere. Setting \(T'(x) = 0\) and solving for \(x\), we have \(\frac{x}{3\sqrt{4+x^2}} = \frac{1}{8}\), so \(8x = 3\sqrt{4+x^2}\). Squaring both sides yields%
\begin{equation*}
64x^2 = 9(4+x^2) = 36 + 9x^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Hence \(55x^2 = 36\), so \(x = \sqrt{\frac{36}{55}} \approx 0.809\). (We don't consider the critical number \(x = -\sqrt{\frac{36}{55}}\) because this doesn't lie in the relevant domain of \(T\).)%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3360}{}%
Finally, we evaluate \(T\) at the only critical number in the interval and at the interval's endpoints. Doing so, we find \(T(0) = \frac{3}{8} + \frac{2}{3} \approx 1.0417\), \(T(3) = \frac{\sqrt{13}}{3} \approx 1.202\), and \(T\left(\sqrt{\frac{36}{55}}\right) = \frac{3}{8} + \frac{\sqrt{55}}{12} \approx 0.993\). Thus the absolute minimum time the hiker can achieve is about \(0.993\) hours, which is attained by hiking about \(2.2\) km from \(P\) towards \(Q\) and then turning into the woods for the remainder of the trip.%

\hypertarget{p-3361}{}%
In more geometric problems, we often use curves or functions to provide natural constraints. For instance, we could investigate which isosceles triangle that circumscribes a unit circle has the smallest area\footnote{You can explore for this problem for yourself at \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/9b}{http://gvsu.edu/s/9b}.\label{fn-32}}, or we might seek the rectangle of largest area that fits within a region bounded by a parabola\footnote{An example of this is shown at \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/9c}{http://gvsu.edu/s/9c}.\label{fn-33}}. The next example is similar to the latter problem.%
\begin{example}[]\label{act-3-4-3}
\hypertarget{p-3362}{}%
Consider the region in the \(xy\)-plane that is bounded by the \(x\)-axis and the function \(f(x) = 25-x^2\). Construct a rectangle whose base lies on the \(x\)-axis and is centered at the origin, and whose sides extend vertically until they intersect the curve \(y = 25-x^2\). Which such rectangle has the maximum possible area? Which such rectangle has the greatest perimeter? Which has the greatest combined perimeter and area? (Challenge: answer the same questions in terms of positive parameters \(a\) and \(b\) for the function \(f(x) = b-ax^2\).)%

\hypertarget{p-3363}{}%

\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Answer.}\hypertarget{answer-146}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-3364}{}%
The maximum area is \(\frac{500}{3\sqrt3}\approx96.225\) square units when the rectangle's base is \(\frac{10}{\sqrt3}\) units long. The maximum perimeter is \(52\) units when the rectangle's base is \(2\) units long. The maximum combined perimeter and area is about \(141.858\), occurring when the rectangle's base is \(\frac{2\sqrt{82}-2}3\approx5.370\) units long.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-173}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-3365}{}%
We start by drawing a picture of the region described, along with a rectangle satisfying the description in the problem. Shown below in \hyperref[F-3-3-region]{Figure~\ref{F-3-3-region}}, this picture will be a useful reference throughout the problem.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/3-3-region.jpg}
\caption{The region in the \(xy\)-plane bounded below by the \(x\)-axis and above by the graph of \(y=25-x^2\). Within this region is a rectangle whose base lies on the \(x\)-axis and is centered at the origin, and whose top corners lie on the curve. Note that if \(x\) represents half the width of the rectangle's base, then the rectangle's height is \(f(x)=25-x^2\).\label{F-3-3-region}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-3366}{}%
As shown in \hyperref[F-3-3-region]{Figure~\ref{F-3-3-region}}, the area of the rectangle is%
\begin{equation*}
A(x) = (2x)(25-x^2) = 50x - 2x^3\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3367}{}%
Based on the region and our definition of \(x\), the only possible values of \(x\) are for \(0 \le x \le 5\); moreover, it is evident that for either \(x = 0\) or \(x = 5\), the area of the corresponding rectangle is zero. Thus the endpoints of the domain \([0,5]\) both minimize the area. Differentiating \(A\) with respect to \(x\) yields%
\begin{equation*}
A'(x) = 50 - 6x^2\text{,}
\end{equation*}
so we find the critical numbers of \(A\) by solving \(6x^2 = 50\). This yields \(x = \pm\frac{5}{\sqrt{3}} \approx \pm2.8868\), but we need only the positive value in this context. Taking \(x=\frac5{\sqrt3}\) gives the maximum possible area of%
\begin{equation*}
A\left(\frac{5}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = \frac{500}{3\sqrt3} \approx 96.225
\end{equation*}
square units.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3368}{}%
We next want to maximize the perimeter. We can see in \hyperref[F-3-3-region]{Figure~\ref{F-3-3-region}} that the rectangle's perimeter is%
\begin{equation*}
P(x) = 2(2x) + 2(25-x^2)= -2x^2 + 4x + 50\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3369}{}%
It is straightforward to show that the only critical number of the quadratic function \(P\) occurs when \(x = 1\) and that the corresponding (maximum) perimeter is \(P(1) = 52\) units.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3370}{}%
Finally, to consider combined area and perimeter, examine the function \(C(x) = A(x) + P(x)\) on the interval \(0 \le x \le 5\). You should find that the only relevant critical number is \(x = \frac{\sqrt{82}-1}{3}\) and that the absolute maximum of \(C\) occurs at that value.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3371}{}%
To summarize, the rectangle with the largest area has vertices at \(\left(0,\pm\frac5{\sqrt3}\right)\) and \(\left(\frac{50}3,\pm\frac5{\sqrt3}\right)\), and has an area of \(\frac{500}{3\sqrt3}\approx96.225\) square units. The rectangle with the largest perimeter has vertices at \(\left(0,\pm1\right)\) and \(\left(24,\pm1\right)\), and has a perimeter of \(52\) units. The rectangle with the largest combined total of perimeter and area has vertices at \(\left(0,\pm\frac{\sqrt{82}-1}3\right)\) and \(\left(\frac{142+2\sqrt{82}}9,\pm\frac{\sqrt{82}-1}3\right)\), and the combined total is approximately \(141.858\).%

A trough is being constructed by bending a \(4 \times 24\) (measured in feet) rectangular piece of sheet metal.%

Two symmetric folds \(2\) feet apart will be made parallel to the longest side of the rectangle so that the trough has cross-sections in the shape of a trapezoid, as pictured below in \hyperref[F-3-4-Act4]{Figure~\ref{F-3-4-Act4}}. At what angle should the folds be made to produce the trough of maximum volume?%

How tall is the trough in terms of \(\theta\)? How wide is the top of the trough, also in terms of \(\theta\)? Find (or add) some useful right triangles to the given diagram to complete the picture. Also, is there a slightly simpler quantity that will be maximized at the same time as the volume? %
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Answer.}\hypertarget{answer-147}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-3375}{}%
 The volume is maximized when \(\theta\approx1.196\) radians.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-174}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-3376}{}%
Once we choose the angle \(\theta\), the two right triangles in the trapezoid are determined and each has a horizontal leg of length \(\cos(\theta)\) and a vertical leg of length \(\sin(\theta)\). Thus the sum of the areas of the two triangles is \(\cos(\theta) \sin(\theta)\), the area of the rectangle between them is \(2\sin(\theta)\), and the total area of the trapezoidal cross-section is%
\begin{equation*}
A(\theta) = \cos(\theta) \sin(\theta) + 2 \sin(\theta)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Because the length of the trough is constant, the trough's volume will be maximized by maximizing cross-sectional area. Note, too, that the domain for \(\theta\) is \(0 \le \theta \le \frac{\pi}{2}\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3377}{}%
Differentiating the area function, we find that%
\begin{equation*}
A'(\theta) =  -\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) + 2 \cos(\theta)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3378}{}%
Using the identity \(\sin^2(\theta) = 1 - \cos^2(\theta)\), it follows that%
\begin{align*}
A'(\theta) =\mathstrut\amp \cos^2(\theta) - 1 + \cos^2(\theta) + 2 \cos(\theta)\\
=\mathstrut\amp 2\cos^2(\theta) + 2 \cos(\theta) - 1\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3379}{}%
This most recent equation is quadratic in \(\cos(\theta)\), so we can solve the equation \(A'(\theta) = 0\) by letting \(u=\cos(\theta)\) and first solving \(2u^2 + 2u - 1 = 0\).\footnote{Note that since \(0\le\theta\le\frac{\pi}2\), we have \(0\le u\le1\).\label{fn-34}} Doing so yields%
\begin{equation*}
u = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.366, -1.366\text{,}
\end{equation*}
so only \(u = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{3}}{2}\) might be a value of the cosine function from an angle that lies in the interval \([0,\frac{\pi}{2}]\). To find the corresponding critical number \(\theta\), we solve \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{3}}{2}\), which implies \(\theta = \arccos\left(\frac{-1 + \sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \approx 1.196\) radians, or \(\theta \approx 68.529^\circ\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3380}{}%
Finally, to confirm that \(A\) has an absolute maximum at \(\theta = \arccos\left(\frac{-1 + \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\), we evaluate \(A\) at this value and at the interval endpoints to find that \(A(0) = 0\), \(A(\frac{\pi}{2}) = 2\), and \(A(1.196) \approx 2.202\) ft\(^2\), which is the absolute maximum possible cross-sectional area.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3381}{}%
Therefore the volume of the trough is maximized (at around \(52.844\) cubic feet) when the sides are folded at an angle of approximately \(1.196\) radians.%

A rectangular box with a square bottom and closed top is to be made from two materials. The material for the side costs \textdollar{}1.50 per square foot and the material for the top and bottom costs \textdollar{}3.00 per square foot. If you are willing to spend \textdollar{}15 on the box, what is the largest volume it can contain? Justify your answer completely using calculus.%
\par\smallskip
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Answer.}\hypertarget{answer-148}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-3385}{}%
The absolute maximum volume is \(V\left( \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}} \right) = \frac{15}{12}\left( \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}} \right) - \frac{1}{4}\left( \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}} \right)^3 \approx 1.07583\) cubic feet.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-175}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-3386}{}%
Let \(x\) be the length of one side of the square bottom and \(h\) the height of one of the sides. We first note that the volume, \(V\), of the box is \(V = x^2 h\), and the surface area of the box is \(S = 2x^2 +  4xh\), since there are two square sides (bottom and top) of area \(x^2\) and four identical sides of area \(xh\). Since the material for the top and bottom costs \textdollar{}3.00 per square foot and the material for the sides costs \textdollar{}1.50 per square foot, it follows that the total cost of a box with surface area \(S\) is%
\begin{equation*}
C = 1.50 (2x^2) +  3.00 (4xh) = 3x^2 + 12xh\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3387}{}%
We are interested in building box of largest volume for which we spend \textdollar{}15. This cost constraint implies that%
\begin{equation*}
15 = 3x^2 + 12xh\text{,}
\end{equation*}
which allows us to express \(h\) as a function of \(x\) by solving for \(h\). Doing so, we see that \(12xh = 15 - 3x^2\), so%
\begin{equation*}
h = \frac{15-3x^2}{12x}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Using this relationship, we are now able to express the volume, \(V\), of the box as a function of the single variable \(x\). Subsituting the expression for \(h\), we have%
\begin{equation*}
V = x^2 h = x^2 \frac{15-3x^2}{12x} = \frac{1}{12}x(15 - 3x^2) = \frac{15}{12}x - \frac{1}{4}x^3\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Note particularly that in order to have a box, we require that both \(x \gt 0\) and \(h \gt 0\). The latter condition along with the fact that \(h = \frac{15-3x^2}{12x}\) shows that we need \(15 - 3x^2 \gt 0\), and thus \(x^2 \lt 5\), so \(x \lt \sqrt{5}\). Hence we are considering \(V(x)\) on the domain \(0 \lt x \lt \sqrt{5}\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3388}{}%
It is apparent that the box vanishes (and its volume tends to zero) as either \(x \to 0^+\) or \(x \to \sqrt{5}^-\), and thus the absolute maximum volume must appear between these values at a critical number. Differentiating \(V\), we find that \(V'(x) = \frac{15}{12} - \frac{3}{4}x^2\). Solving \(V'(x) = 0\) to find all critical numbers of \(V\) in the domain, we see that \(x^2 = \frac{15}{12} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{5}{3}\), and thus \(x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}}\), so only \(x = \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}}\) is a critical number that lies in \(0 \lt x \lt \sqrt{5}\). Noting that the absolute minimum volume \(V = 0\) occurs at each endpoint, it must be the case that the absolute maximum volume is \(V\left( \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}} \right) = \frac{15}{12}\left( \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}} \right) - \frac{1}{4}\left( \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}} \right)^3 \approx 1.07583\) cubic feet.%

We want to maximize the area of each subrectangular region, which is the same as maximizing the total area \(A = xy\) of the entire rectangular region. Since \(A\) has two variables, we can't yet directly apply calculus techniques to it. We use the information about the amount of fencing to relate \(x\) and \(y\) in order to write \(A\) in terms of just one variable.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3393}{}%
In the case of the fencing option on the left in the figure, the total amount of fencing that is needed to enclose the four grazing areas is \(2x+5y\). We assume that all of the \(7500\) feet of fencing will be used, so \(2x+5y=7500\). Solving for \(x\), \(x = 3750 - 2.5y\). Substituting this expression for \(x\) into the area formula allows us to write \(A\) in terms of \(y\) alone:%
\begin{equation*}
A(y) = (3750-2.5y)y = 3750y - 2.5y^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
To enclose any area, we of course must have \(y \gt 0\) and \(x \gt 0\), and since \(x = 3750 - 2.5y\), it follows that we need to have \(2.5y \lt 3750\) so \(y \lt 1500\). To find the maximum value of \(A\) on this domain, we find the critical numbers of \(A\). Since \(A'(y) = 3750 - 5y\), we see that \(A'(y) = 0\) when and only when \(y = 750\). For \(0 \lt y \lt 750\), we see that \(A'(y) \gt 0\) and for \(750 \lt y \lt 1500\) we have \(A'(y) \lt 0\). So \(A(750) = 1406250\) square feet is the absolute maximum value of \(A\). The maximum possible area that each of the four pens can enclose is one quarter of the total, or \(351562.5\) square feet.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3394}{}%
In the case of the fencing option on the right in the figure, the total amount of fencing that is needed to enclose the four grazing areas is \(3x+3y\). We assume that all of the \(7500\) feet of fencing will be used, so \(3x + 3y = 7500\). Solving for \(x\) and substituting into \(A\), we find \(x = 2500 - y\) and%
\begin{equation*}
A(y) = (2500-y)y = 2500y - y^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
To enclose any area, we of course must have \(y \gt 0\) and \(x \gt 0\), and since \(x = 2500 - y\), it follows that we need to have \(y \lt 2500\). To find the maximum value of \(A\) on this domain, we find the critical numbers of \(A\). Since \(A'(y) = 2500 - 2y\), we see that \(A'(y) = 0\) when and only when \(y = 1250\). For \(0 \lt y \lt 1250\), we see that \(A'(y) \gt 0\) and for \(1250 \lt y \lt 2500\) we have \(A'(y) \lt 0\). So \(A(1250) = 1406250\) square feet is the absolute maximum value of \(A\). The maximum possible area that each of the four pens can enclose is one quarter of the total, or \(390625\) square feet.%

The total amount of cable, \(L\), used (which we wish to minimize) is given by \(L = y + z\). We can use the geometry of the situation to write both \(y\) and \(z\) in terms of \(x\). In the first right triangle, by the Pythagorean Theorem we know that \(x^2 + 60^2 = y^2\), and thus \(y = \sqrt{x^2 + 3600}\). In the second right triangle, note that the horizontal leg of the triangle has length \(100-x\), and thus \((100-x)^2 + 80^2 = z^2\), so \(z = \sqrt{(100-x)^2 + 6400}\). It follows that with \(L = y + z\),%
\begin{equation*}
L(x) = \sqrt{x^2 + 3600} + \sqrt{6400 + (100-x)^2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
It is also apparent from the given situation that the relevant domain for \(L\) is \(0 \le x \le 100\). Given that we want to minimize \(L\) on this closed interval, it remains to find any critical numbers of \(L\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3400}{}%
We note by the chain rule that%
\begin{equation*}
L'(x) = \frac{2x}{2(x^2+3600)^{1/2}} + \frac{-2(100-x)}{2((100-x)^2 + 6400)^{1/2}}
\end{equation*}
We use technology to solve the equation \(L'(x) = 0\) and find that it has a single solution in the interval \(0 \le x \le 100\): \(x \approx 42.85714\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3401}{}%
To find the absolute minimum of \(L\) on the relevant domain, we evaluate \(L\) at the endpoints and the only critical number. Doing so, we fine \(L(0) \approx 188.062\), \(L(100) \approx 196.619\), and \(L(42.85714) \approx 172.047\). Hence the least amount of cable we can use is approximately \(172.047\) feet and is accomplished by anchoring the cable about \(42.85714\) feet from the first tower.%
\item[9.]\hypertarget{exercise-209}{}(Minimizing construction costs)\space\space{}\hypertarget{p-3402}{}%
A company is designing propane tanks that are cylindrical with hemispherical ends. Assume that the company wants tanks that will hold 1000 cubic feet of gas, and that the ends are more expensive to make, costing \textdollar{}5 per square foot, while the cylindrical barrel between the ends costs \textdollar{}2 per square foot. Use calculus to determine the minimum cost to construct such a tank.%
\par\smallskip
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Answer.}\hypertarget{answer-151}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-3403}{}%
The minimum cost is \textdollar{}1165.70.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-178}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-3404}{}%
We let the length of the cylindrical part of the tank be \(h\) with the radius of the cylinder given by \(r\). It follows that the radius of the hemispherical ends of the tank is also \(r\). We first identify formulas for both the volume and surface area of the tank by looking at the cylindrical and hemispherical pieces.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3405}{}%
The cylindrical part of the tank has volume \(V_c = \pi r^2 h\), and the surface area of its sides is \(A_c = 2\pi r h\) (which is the circumference of the cylinder's base times the cylinder's height -- think about how a cylinder unfurls to form a rectangle). The two hemispherical ends together constitute a full sphere, and the volume of a sphere is \(V_s = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3\), while the surface area of a sphere is \(A_s = 4 \pi r^2\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3406}{}%
The overall volume of the tank is therefore%
\begin{equation*}
V = V_c + V_s = \pi r^2 h + \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and its total surface area is%
\begin{equation*}
A = A_c + A_s = 2\pi r h + 4 \pi r^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Moreover, taking into account the different costs of material for the cylindrical sides and hemispherical ends, we find that the total cost of the tank is%
\begin{equation*}
C = 2(2\pi r h) + 5(4 \pi r^2) = 4 \pi r h + 20 \pi r^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3407}{}%
Our goal is to minimize the total cost of the tank given that we want it to hold 1000 cubic meters of volume. From this constraint, we have the equation \(1000 = \pi r^2 h + \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3\), which we can solve for \(h\) to get \(\pi r^2 h = 1000 - \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3\), so%
\begin{equation*}
h = \frac{1000 - \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}{\pi r^2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
This allows us to now write cost as a function of the single variable \(r\) by substituting the expression for \(h\) into the earlier formula we found for cost. In particular,%
\begin{equation*}
C(r) = 4 \pi r \frac{1000 - \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}{\pi r^2} + 20 \pi r^2 = 4 \frac{1000 - \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}{r} + 20\pi r^2
\end{equation*}
Simplifying further, we have found that%
\begin{equation*}
C(r) = \frac{4000}{r} - \frac{16}{3}\pi r^2 + 20 \pi r^2 = \frac{4000}{r} + \frac{44}{3}r^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Based on the physical constraints of the problem, we obviously will only consider values of \(r \gt 0\) and \(h \gt 0\). Since \(h = \frac{1000 - \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}{\pi r^2}\), we must have%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \lt 1000
\end{equation*}
so \(r^3 \lt \frac{3}{4} \cdot 1000 = 750\), and thus \(r \lt \sqrt[3]{750} \approx 9.086\). We now work to minimize \(C(r)\) on the interval \(0 \lt r \lt \sqrt[3]{750}\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3408}{}%
Taking the derivative of \(C\), we find that \(C'(r) = -\frac{4000}{r^2} + \frac{88}{3}r\). Setting \(C'(r) = 0\), it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{4000}{r^2} = \frac{88}{3}r
\end{equation*}
and thus%
\begin{equation*}
4000 \cdot \frac{3}{88} = r^3\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Therefore, \(r^3 = \frac{1500}{11}\), so \(r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{1500}{11}} \approx 5.147\) is the only critical number of \(C\); observe that it lies within the interval \(0 \lt r \lt \sqrt[3]{750}\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3409}{}%
If we plot the derivative function, \(y = C'(r)\), on the interval \(0 \lt r \lt \sqrt[3]{750}\), we see that for \(0 \lt r \lt 5.147\), \(C'(r) \lt 0\), and for \(5.147 \lt r \lt 9.086\), \(C'(r) \gt 0\), which shows that \(C\) is decreasing before the critical number and increasing after the critical number, and hence \(C\) has a global minimum of \(C(\sqrt[3]{\frac{1500}{11}}) \approx 1165.70\), so \textdollar{}1165.70 is the minimum cost to build the desired tank under the given constraints.%

\item{}\hypertarget{p-3410}{}%
Given a family of functions that depends on one or more parameters, how does the shape of the graph of a typical function in the family depend on the value of the parameters?%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3411}{}%
How can we construct first and second derivative sign charts of functions that depend on one or more parameters while allowing those parameters to remain arbitrary constants?%

Mathematicians are often interested in making general observations, say by describing patterns that hold in a large number of cases. Think about the Pythagorean Theorem: it doesn't tell us something about a single right triangle, but rather a fact about \emph{every} right triangle. In the next part of our studies, we use calculus to make general observations about families of functions that depend on one or more \terminology{parameters}. \index{parameters} People who use applied mathematics, such as engineers and economists, often encounter the same types of functions where only small changes to certain constants occur. These constants are called parameters.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.65\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/3_2_SineFam.pdf}
\caption{The graph of \(y=f(t)\), where \(f(t) = a \sin(b(t-c)) + d\), based on parameters \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\).\label{F-3-2-SineFam}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-3413}{}%
You are already familiar with certain families of functions. For example, \(f(t) = a \sin(b(t-c)) + d\) is a stretched and shifted version of the sine function with amplitude \(a\), period \(\frac{2\pi}{b}\), phase shift \(c\), and vertical shift \(d\). We know that \(a\) affects the size of the oscillation, \(b\) the rapidity of oscillation, and \(c\) where the oscillation starts, as shown above in \hyperref[F-3-2-SineFam]{Figure~\ref{F-3-2-SineFam}}, while \(d\) affects the vertical positioning of the graph.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3414}{}%
Here is another example: every function of the form \(y = mx + b\) is a line with slope \(m\) and \(y\)-intercept \((0,b)\). The value of \(m\) affects the line's steepness, and the value of \(b\) situates the line vertically on the coordinate axes. These two parameters describe all possible non-vertical lines.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3415}{}%
For other less familiar families of functions, we can use calculus to discover where key behavior occurs: e.g. where members of the family are increasing or decreasing, concave up or concave down, where relative extrema occur, and more, all in terms of the parameters involved. To get started, we revisit a common collection of functions to see how calculus confirms things we already know.%
\begin{example}[]\label{PA-3-2}
\hypertarget{p-3416}{}%

\item\hypertarget{li-2236}{}\hypertarget{p-3435}{}%
Since \(f\) is a second-degree polynomial in \(x\), \(f\) is a quadratic function, and the graph of \(y=f(x)\) is a parabola. The vertex of this parabola is at the point \((h,k)\), and the sign of \(a\) determines whether the parabola opens upward (when \(a\gt0\)) or downward (when \(a\lt0\)).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2237}{}\hypertarget{p-3436}{}%
Because \(h\) and \(k\) are constants, their derivatives are both \(0\) and this simplifies the application of the sum rule in taking the derivative. Furthermore, the product rule is unnecessary because \(a\) is a constant as well, so we instead make use of the constant multiple rule. Doing so while also applying the chain rule, we find that%
\begin{equation*}
f'(x)=2a(x-h)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-2238}{}\hypertarget{p-3437}{}%
Since \(f'\) is linear with slope \(2a\neq0\), it is continuous (hence, defined everywhere) and has exactly one root (where \(f'(x)=0\)). Thus the function \(f\) will have exactly one critical number. Indeed, we see that \(f'(x)=0\) only at the point \(x=h\). Therefore, the only critical number of \(f\) is \(h\). We note that this agrees with our previous assertion that the vertex of \(y=f(x)\) is at the point \((h,k)\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2239}{}\hypertarget{p-3438}{}%
If \(a\lt0\), then our algebra knowledge tells us that the graph of \(y=f(x)\) is a parabola that opens down, so we should find that \(f\) is increasing for \(x\lt h\) and decreasing for \(x\gt h\). Testing this intuition, we note that %
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}When \(x\lt h\), then \(x-h\lt0\) and hence \(2a(x-h)\gt0\) since \(a\) also is known to be negative. Therefore, on the interval \((-\infty,h)\) we have \(f'(x)\gt0\) and \(f\) increasing.%
\item{}When \(x\gt h\), then \(x-h\gt0\) and hence \(2a(x-h)\lt0\) since \(a\) is known to be negative. Therefore, on the interval \((h,\infty)\) we have \(f'(x)\lt0\) and \(f\) decreasing.%
\end{itemize}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-2242}{}\hypertarget{p-3439}{}%
Applying the first derivative test, we see that at the point \(x=h\), the value of \(f'(x)\) switches from positive to negative, and thus \(k\), the critical value corresponding to the critical number \(h\), is a maximum of \(f\). This agrees with our existing knowledge of parabolas, as we had established that this parabola opens downward.%

\hypertarget{p-3440}{}%
Our goal is to describe the key characteristics of the overall behavior of each member of a family of functions in terms of its parameters. By finding the first and second derivatives and constructing sign charts (each of which may depend on one or more of the parameters), we can often make broad conclusions about how each member of the family will appear.%
\begin{example}[]\label{Ex-3-2-1}
\hypertarget{p-3441}{}%
Consider the two-parameter family of functions given by \(g(x) = axe^{-bx}\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are positive real numbers. Fully describe the behavior of a typical member of the family in terms of \(a\) and \(b\), including: the location of all critical numbers; where \(g\) is increasing, decreasing, concave up, and concave down; and the long-term behavior of \(g\).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Hint.}\hypertarget{hint-90}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-3442}{}%
Start by finding the first and second derivatives of \(g\). Be careful with your use of the product rule and chain rule.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Answer.}\hypertarget{answer-153}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-3443}{}%
\(g\) has one critical number, at \(x=\frac1b\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3444}{}%
\(g\) is increasing on \(\big(-\infty,\frac1b\big)\), decreasing on \(\big(\frac1b,\infty\big)\), concave down on \(\big(-\infty,\frac2b\big)\), and concave up on \(\big(\frac2b,\infty\big)\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3445}{}%
\(\lim_{x\to-\infty}g(x)=-\infty\) and \(\lim_{x\to\infty}g(x)=0\).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-180}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-3446}{}%
We begin by computing \(g'(x)\). By the product rule,%
\begin{equation*}
g'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}[ax]e^{-bx} +ax \frac{d}{dx}\left[e^{-bx}\right] \text{.}
\end{equation*}
By applying the chain rule and constant multiple rule, we find that%
\begin{equation*}
g'(x) = ae^{-bx}+axe^{-bx}(-b)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3447}{}%
To find the critical numbers of \(g\), we note that \(g'\) is defined everywhere and proceed to solve the equation \(g'(x) = 0\). By factoring \(g'(x)\), we find%
\begin{equation*}
0 = ae^{-bx}(1-bx)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3448}{}%
Since we are given that \(a \ne 0\) and we know that \(e^{-bx} \ne 0\) for all values of \(x\), the only way this equation can hold is when \(1-bx = 0\). Solving for \(x\), we find \(x = \frac{1}{b}\), and this is therefore the only critical number of \(g\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3449}{}%
Because the factor \(ae^{-bx}\) is always positive, the sign of \(g'\) depends on the linear factor \((1-bx)\), which is positive for \(x \lt \frac{1}{b}\) and negative for \(x \gt \frac{1}{b}\). Hence we can not only conclude that \(g\) is always increasing for \(x \lt \frac{1}{b}\) and decreasing for \(x \gt \frac{1}{b}\), but also that \(g\) has a global maximum at \(\big(\frac{1}{b}, g\big(\frac{1}{b}\big)\big)\) and no local minimum. The first derivative sign chart for \(g\) is shown below in \hyperref[F-3-2-signchartg]{Figure~\ref{F-3-2-signchartg}}.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/3_2_signchartg.pdf}
\caption{The first derivative sign chart for \(g(x) = axe^{-bx}\).\label{F-3-2-signchartg}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-3450}{}%
We turn next to analyzing the concavity of \(g\). With \(g'(x) = ae^{-bx}-abxe^{-bx}\), we differentiate to find that%
\begin{equation*}
g''(x) = ae^{-bx}(-b)-ab\left(e^{-bx}+xe^{-bx}(-b)\right)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3451}{}%
Combining like terms and factoring, we now have%
\begin{equation*}
g''(x) = ab^2xe^{-bx} - 2abe^{-bx} = abe^{-bx}(bx - 2)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3452}{}%
We observe that \(abe^{-bx}\) is always positive, and thus the sign of \(g''\) depends on the sign of \((bx-2)\), which is zero when \(x = \frac{2}{b}\). Since \(b\) is positive, the value of \((bx-2)\) is negative for \(x \lt \frac{2}{b}\) and positive for \(x \gt \frac{2}{b}\). The sign chart for \(g''\) is shown below in \hyperref[F-3-2-signchartg2]{Figure~\ref{F-3-2-signchartg2}}. Thus, \(g\) is concave down for all \(x \lt \frac{2}{b}\) and concave up for all \(x \gt \frac{2}{b}\).%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/3_2_signchartg2.pdf}
\caption{The second derivative sign chart for \(g(x) = axe^{-bx}\).\label{F-3-2-signchartg2}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-3453}{}%
Finally, we analyze the long-term behavior of \(g\) by considering two limits. First, we note that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to \infty} g(x) = \lim_{x \to \infty} axe^{-bx} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{ax}{e^{bx}}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3454}{}%
This limit has indeterminate form \(\frac{\infty}{\infty}\), so with our current tools, we can not evaluate the limit algebraically. We can, however, reason that \(ax\) is linear while \(e^{bx}\) is exponential, and conclude that because exponential growth is so much more rapid than linear growth, we expect the limiting value to be zero. A more rigorous answer will be possible following \hyperref[sec-2-8-LHR]{Section~\ref{sec-2-8-LHR}}, but for now we can also use graphical evidence\footnote{A good tool to use here is \href{http://www.desmos.com/calculator/vvscoo435h}{desmos.com}.\label{fn-35}} to support the claim that \(\lim_{x\to\infty}g(x)=0\). We do so by examining the graphs of several different functions in this family, noting that each has a horizontal asymptote of \(y=0\) as \(x\to\infty\).  In the other direction,%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to -\infty} g(x) = \lim_{x \to -\infty} axe^{-bx} = -\infty\text{,}
\end{equation*}
because \(ax \to -\infty\) and \(e^{-bx} \to \infty\) as \(x \to -\infty\). Hence, as we move left on its graph, \(g\) decreases without bound, while as we move to the right, \(g(x) \to 0\).%

All of this information now helps us produce the graph of a typical member of this family of functions without using a graphing utility (and without choosing particular values for \(a\) and \(b\)), as shown in \hyperref[F-3-2-SurgeFam]{Figure~\ref{F-3-2-SurgeFam}} below.%

\hypertarget{p-3456}{}%
Note that the value of \(b\) controls the horizontal location of the global maximum and the inflection point, as neither depends on \(a\). The value of \(a\) affects the vertical stretch of the graph. For example, the global maximum occurs at the point \(\big(\frac{1}{b}, g\big(\frac{1}{b}\big)\big) = \big(\frac{1}{b}, \frac{a}{b}e^{-1}\big)\), so the larger the value of \(a\), the greater the value of the global maximum.%

The work we've completed in \hyperref[Ex-3-2-1]{Example~\ref{Ex-3-2-1}} can often be replicated for other families of functions that depend on parameters. Normally we are most interested in determining all critical numbers, a first derivative sign chart, a second derivative sign chart, and the limit of the function as \(x \to \infty\). Throughout, we prefer to work with the parameters as arbitrary constants. In addition, we can experiment with some particular values of the parameters present to reduce the algebraic complexity of our work. What follows are several key examples where we see that the values of the parameters substantially affect the behavior of individual functions within a given family.%
\begin{example}[]\label{act-3-2-1}
\hypertarget{p-3458}{}%

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-2257}{}\hypertarget{p-3476}{}%
We first note that \(p'(x) = 3x^2 - a\), so to find critical numbers we set \(p'(x) = 0\) and solve for \(x\). This leads to the equation \(3x^2 - a = 0\), which implies%
\begin{equation*}
x^2 = \frac{a}{3}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
If \(a \gt 0\), then the solutions to this equation are \(x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}\); if \(a \lt  0\), then the equation has no solution. Hence, \(p\) has two critical numbers \(\left(x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}\right)\) whenever \(a \gt 0\) and no critical numbers when \(a \lt  0\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2258}{}\hypertarget{p-3477}{}%
For the case when \(a \lt 0\), we observe that \(p'(x) = 3x^2 - a\) is positive for every value of \(x\), and thus \(p\) is always increasing and has no relative extreme values. (There are no critical numbers to place on the first derivative sign chart, and \(p'\) is always positive.) For the case when \(a\gt 0\), we observe that \(p'(x) = 3x^2 - a\) is a concave up parabola with zeros at \(x = -\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}\) and \(x = +\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}\). It follows that for \(x \lt -\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}\), \(p'(x)\gt 0\) (so \(p\) is increasing); for \(-\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}} \lt x \lt \sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}\), \(p'(x)\gt 0\) (so \(p\) is decreasing); and for \(x\gt \sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}\), \(p'(x)\gt 0\) (so \(p\) is again increasing). In this situation, we see that \(p\) has a relative maximum at \(x = -\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}\) and a relative minimum at \(x = +\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2259}{}\hypertarget{p-3478}{}%
Since \(p'(x) = 3x^2 - a\) and \(a\) is constant, it follows that \(p''(x) = 6x\). Note that \(p''(x) = 0\) when \(x = 0\) and that \(p''(x) \lt 0\) for \(x \lt 0\) and \(p''(x)\gt 0\) for \(x\gt 0\). Hence \(p\) is concave down for \(x \lt 0\) and \(p\) is concave up for \(x\gt 0\), making \(x = 0\) an inflection point.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2260}{}\hypertarget{p-3479}{}%
Below, we show the two possible situations. At left, for the case when \(a \lt 0\) and \(p\) is always increasing with an inflection point at \(x = 0\), and at right for when \(a\gt 0\) and \(p\) has a relative maximum at \(x = -\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}\) and a relative minimum at \(x = +\sqrt{\frac{a}{3}}\), again with an inflection point at \(x = 0\). Note, too, that \(p\) has its \(x\)-intercepts at \(x = \pm \sqrt{a}\).%

Since \(h(x) = a - ae^{-bx}\), we have by the constant multiple and chain rules that%
\begin{equation*}
h'(x) = -ae^{-bx}(-b) = abe^{-bx}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive constants and \(e^{-bx} \gt 0\) for all \(x\), we see that \(h'(x)\) is never zero (nor undefined), and indeed \(h'(x) \gt 0\) for all \(x\). Hence \(h\) is an always increasing function.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2278}{}\hypertarget{p-3500}{}%
Because \(h'(x) = abe^{-bx}\), we have that \(h''(x) = abe^{-bx}(-b) = -ab^2e^{-bx}\). As with \(h'\), we recognize that \(a\), \(b^2\), and \(e^{-bx}\) are always positive, and thus \(h''(x) = -ab^2e^{-bx} \lt 0\) for all values of \(x\), making \(h\) always concave down.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2279}{}\hypertarget{p-3501}{}%
As \(x \to \infty\), \(e^{-bx} \to 0\). Thus,%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to \infty} a(1-e^{-bx}) = \lim_{x \to \infty} (a - ae^{-bx}) = a - 0 = a\text{.}
\end{equation*}
This shows that \(h\) has a horizontal asymptote at \(y = a\) as we move rightward on its graph. As \(x \to -\infty\), \(e^{-bx} \to \infty\). Thus,%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to -\infty} a(1-e^{-bx}) = \lim_{x \to -\infty} (a - ae^{-bx}) = -\infty\text{.}

%
\item\hypertarget{li-2280}{}\hypertarget{p-3502}{}%
Noting that \(h'(x) = abe^{-bx}\), we see that if we consider different values of \(b\), the slope of the graph changes. If \(b\) is large and \(x\) is close to zero, \(h'(x) \approx ab\) (since \(e^0 = 1\)), so \(h'(x)\) is relatively large near \(x = 0\). At the same time, for large \(b\), \(e^{-bx}\) approaches zero quickly as \(x\) increases, so the curve's slope will quickly approach zero as \(x\) increases. If \(b\) is small, the graph is less steep near \(x = 0\) and its slope goes to zero less quickly as \(x\) increases.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2281}{}\hypertarget{p-3503}{}%
Observing that \(h(0) = 0\) and \(\lim_{x \to \infty} h(x) = a\), along with the facts that \(h\) is always increasing and always concave down, we see that a typical member of this family looks like the following graph.%

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-2300}{}\hypertarget{p-3525}{}%
By the chain rule and treating \(A\), \(c\), and \(k\) as constants, we find that%
\begin{equation*}
L'(t) = A(-1)(1+ce^{-kt})^{-2} ce^{-kt}(-k) = Acke^{-kt}(1+ce^{-kt})^{-2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Since \(A\), \(c\), and \(k\) are all positive and \(e^{-kt} \gt 0\) for all values of \(t\), it is apparent that \(L'(t)\) is never zero (nor undefined), and indeed is positive for every value of \(t\). Thus, \(L\) is an always increasing function.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2301}{}\hypertarget{p-3526}{}%
Given that%
\begin{equation*}
L''(t) = Ack^2e^{-kt} \frac{ce^{-kt}-1}{(1+ce^{-kt})^3}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
the only way \(L''(t) = 0\) is if \(ce^{-kt}-1 = 0\). Solving \(ce^{-kt}-1 = 0\) for \(t\), we first write \(e^{-kt} = \frac{1}{c}\). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides yields \(-kt = \ln\big(\frac{1}{c}\big)\), so that%
\begin{equation*}
t = -\frac{1}{k} \ln \left(\frac{1}{c}\right)
\end{equation*}
is the only value of \(t\) for which \(L''(t) = 0\). Now, observe that since \(ce^{-kt} \to 0\) as \(t \to \infty\) and \(ce^{-kt}\to\infty\) as \(t\to-\infty\), it follows that the quantity \(ce^{-kt} - 1\) will be positive to the left of where it is zero and negative to the right of where it is zero. Since this is the only term in \(L''(t)\) that can change sign, it follows that \(L''(t) \gt 0\) for \(t \lt  -\frac{1}{k} \ln \big(\frac{1}{c}\big)\) and \(L''(t) \lt 0\) for \(t \gt -\frac{1}{k} \ln \big(\frac{1}{c}\big)\), making \(L\) concave up to the left of the noted inflection point and concave down thereafter.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2302}{}\hypertarget{p-3527}{}%
Recalling that \(e^{-kt} \to 0\) as \(t \to \infty\), we observe that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{A}{1+ce^{-kt}} = \frac{A}{1+0} = A\text{,}
\end{equation*}
so \(L\) has a horizontal asymptote of \(y = A\) as \(t \to \infty\). On the other hand, since \(e^{-kt} \to \infty\) as \(t \to -\infty\), this causes the denominator of \(L\) to grow without bound (while the numerator remains constant), and therefore%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{t \to -\infty} \frac{A}{1+ce^{-kt}} = 0\text{,}
\end{equation*}
which means \(L\) has a horizontal asymptote of \(y = 0\) as \(t \to -\infty\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2303}{}\hypertarget{p-3528}{}%
From (b), we know that \(t = -\frac{1}{k} \ln \big(\frac{1}{c}\big)\) is the location of the inflection point of \(L\). We evaluate \(L\big( -\frac{1}{k} \ln \big(\frac{1}{c}\big) \big)\),\footnote{If you prefer to evaluate the function without this apparent ``shortcut'', be careful with parentheses as you plug in and evaluate. In particular, notice that we do indeed have \(ce^{-k\left[-\frac{\ln(\frac{1}{c})}{k}\right]}=ce^{k\frac{\ln(\frac{1}{c})}{k}}=ce^{\ln(\frac{1}{c})}=c(\frac{1}{c})=1\). The remainder of the calculation should match what is shown below.\label{fn-36}} recalling that at this \(t\)-value we have the equality \(ce^{-kt}=1\), thus%
\begin{equation*}
L\left( -\frac{1}{k} \ln \left(\frac{1}{c}\right) \right) = \frac{A}{1+1} = \frac{A}{2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Thus, the inflection point on the graph of \(L\) is located at  \(\big( -\frac{1}{k} \ln \big(\frac{1}{c}\big), \frac{A}{2}\big)\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2304}{}\hypertarget{p-3529}{}%
We have shown that \(L\) is an always increasing function that has horizontal asymptotes at \(y =0\) and \(y = A\), as well as an inflection point at \(\big( -\frac{1}{k} \ln \big(\frac{1}{c}\big), \frac{A}{2}\big)\), which we note lies vertically halfway between the asymptotes. In addition, we see that \(L(0) = \frac{A}{1+c}\). The combination of all of this information shows us that a typical graph in this family of functions is given by the following figure.%

Given a family of functions that depends on one or more parameters, we can often accurately describe the shape of the function in terms of the parameters by investigating how critical numbers and locations where the second derivative is zero depend on the values of these parameters.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3533}{}%
In particular, just as we can creat first and second derivative sign charts for a single function, we can often do so for entire families of functions where critical numbers and possible inflection points depend on arbitrary constants. These sign charts then reveal where members of the family are increasing or decreasing, concave up or concave down, and help us to identify relative extrema and inflection points.%

To find the critical numbers of \(p\), we first compute \(p'(x)\). Treating \(a\) as constant, we have \(p'(x) = 3x^2 - 2ax = x(3x - 2a)\). Thus, setting \(p'(x) = 0\), we find that \(x(3x-2a) = 0\) and thus \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{2a}{3}\) are the critical numbers of \(p\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2318}{}\hypertarget{p-3546}{}%
Observe that \(p''(x) = 6x - 2a\) and thus \(p''(x) = 0\) implies that \(x = \frac{a}{2}\). Since \(p''(x)\) is linear with positive slope, we see that \(p''(x)\) changes sign from negative to positive at \(x = \frac{a}{2}\), and thus \(p\) is concave down for \(x \lt \frac{a}{2}\) and concave up for \(x \gt \frac{a}{2}\) and \(x = \frac{a}{2}\) is the only inflection point of \(p\).%

\item\hypertarget{li-2330}{}\hypertarget{p-3560}{}%
The value of the numerator at \(x=c\) is \(e^{-c} \ne 0\), while the value of the denominator is \(0\) at \(x=c\). Thus, \(\lim_{x \to c^+} \frac{e^{-x}}{x-c} = \infty\) and \(\lim_{x \to c^-} \frac{e^{-x}}{x-c} = -\infty\). This makes the line \(x=c\) a vertical asymptote for \(q\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2331}{}\hypertarget{p-3561}{}%
We can write \(q(x)\) as \(q(x) = \frac{1}{(x-c)e^x}\) and thus see the denominator increases without bound as \(x \to \infty\). Therefore, \(\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{e^{-x}}{x-c} = 0\). This makes the line \(y=0\) a horizontal asymptote for \(q\). As \(x \to -\infty\), \(e^{-x}\) increases without bound, while \((x-c)\) decreases without bound. Thus, \(q\) has an indeterminate form as \(x \to -infty\). Applying L'Hopital's Rule gives us%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to -\infty} \frac{e^{-x}}{x-c} = \lim_{x \to -\infty} \frac{-e^{-x}}{1} = -\infty\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-2332}{}\hypertarget{p-3562}{}%
Using \(q(x) = \frac{1}{(x-c)e^x}\), the quotient and product rules along with algebraic simplification show that%
\begin{equation*}
q'(x) = -\frac{(x-c)e^x + e^x}{(x-c)^2\left(e^x\right)^2} = -\frac{x-c+1}{(x-c)^2e^x}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
The function \(q\) has critical points in its domain where \(q'(x) = 0\) or \(q'(x)\) doesn't exist. Note that \(q'(x)\) is undefined at \(x=c\), but \(c\) is not in the domain of mq. Thus, the only critical points of \(q\) occur when \(q'(x)=0\). The only way the fraction \(q'(x)\) can be \(0\) is if the numerator is \(0\). Since \(x-c+1=0\) when \(x=c-1\), the only critical number for \(q\) is \(x=c-1\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2333}{}\hypertarget{p-3563}{}%
The values of the exponential function \(e^x\) and the quadratic \((x-c)^2\) are positive for \(x \neq c\), so the sign of \(q'(x) = -\frac{x-c+1}{(x-c)^2e^x}\) depends entirely on the sign of \(x-(c-1)\). When \(x \lt c-1\) we see that \(q'(x) \gt 0\) and when \(x \gt c-1\) we have \(q'(x) \lt 0\). Thus, \(q\) is increasing on \((-\infty,
c-1)\) and is decreasing on \((c-1,c)\), so it follows that \(q(c-1)\) is a relative maximum value. This value is a local maximum, since the value of \(q\) can be made as large as we like as shown in part (b).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2334}{}\hypertarget{p-3564}{}%
We've shown that a typical member of the family of functions given by \(q(x) = \frac{1}{(x-c)e^x}\) has a vertical asymptote at \(x = c\) and a critical number at which a local maximum occurs one unit to the left of \(c\) at \(x = c-1\). A typical such graph is shown below. Note how \(q\) is increasing and decreasing according to our earlier work in (d).%

Treating \(m\) and \(s\) as constants, by the chain rule,%
\begin{equation*}
E'(x) = e^{-\frac{(x-m)^2}{2s^2}} \cdot \frac{d}{dx}\left[ -\frac{(x-m)^2}{2s^2} \right] = e^{-\frac{(x-m)^2}{2s^2}} \cdot \left[ -\frac{2(x-m)}{2s^2} \right]
\end{equation*}
Note that \(E'(x)\) is defined for every value of \(x\), thus the only critical numbers occur where \(E'(x) = 0\). Since \(e\) raised to any power is never zero, the only way that \(E'(x) = 0\) is for \(\left[ -\frac{2(x-m)}{2s^2} \right] = 0\), which implies that \(x = m\). Thus, \(x = m\) is the only critical number of \(E\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2346}{}\hypertarget{p-3578}{}%
As we noted in (a), \(x = m\) is the only critical number of \(E\). More over, since \(e\) to any power is always positive, the sign of \(E'(x)\) depends entirely on the expression \(-\frac{2(x-m)}{2s^2} = -\frac{1}{2}(x-m)\). This linear function of \(x\) has negative slope, and thus is positive for \(x \lt m\) and negative for \(x \gt m\), and thus \(E'(x)\) is positive for \(x \lt m\) and negative for \(x \gt m\). Therefore, \(E\) is increasing for \(x \lt m\) and decreasing for \(x \gt m\), with a local maximum at \(x = m\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2347}{}\hypertarget{p-3579}{}%
From the given formula for \(E''(x)\) and our knowledge that \(e\) to any power is positive, the only way \(E''(x) = 0\) is for%
\begin{equation*}
\left(\frac{(x-m)^2 - s^2}{s^4} \right) = 0\text{,}
\end{equation*}
which implies that \((x-m)^2 = s^2\), and therefore \(x-m = \pm s\), or \(x = m \pm s\). These are the two values for which \(E''(x) = 0\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2348}{}\hypertarget{p-3580}{}%
As \(x \to \pm \infty\), we know that the quadratic function \(-\frac{(x-m)^2}{2s^2}\) must decrease without bound because the quadratic function opens down. Thus, the power to which we are raising \(e\) in the formula for \(E(x)\) is decreasing without bound, which means that \(E(x)\) must approach \(0\) since raising \(e\) to more and more negative numbers drives the result to \(0\). Thus, \(\lim_{x \to \infty} E(x) = \lim_{x \to -\infty} E(x) = 0\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2349}{}\hypertarget{p-3581}{}%
We've shown that \(E\) has a single critical number at \(x = m\) and two potential points of inflection at \(x = m \pm s\), as well as that \(E(x) \to 0\) as \(x \to \pm \infty\). All of these properties are reflected in the following figure.%

\item{}\hypertarget{p-3582}{}%
If two quantities that are related, such as the radius and volume of a spherical balloon, are both changing as implicit functions of time, how are their rates of change related? That is, how does the relationship between the values of the quantities affect the relationship between their respective derivatives with respect to time?%
\end{itemize}
\end{objectives}
\hypertarget{p-3583}{}%
In most of our applications of the derivative so far, we have been interested in the instantaneous rate at which one variable, perhaps called \(y\), changes with respect to another, perhaps called \(x\), leading us to compute and interpret \(\frac{dy}{dx}\). We next consider situations where several variable quantities are related, but where each quantity is implicitly a function of time, which will be represented by the variable \(t\). Through knowing how the quantities are related, we will be interested in determining how their respective rates of change with respect to time are related.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3584}{}%
For example, suppose that air is being pumped into a spherical balloon so that its volume increases at a constant rate. Since the balloon's volume and radius are related, we ought to be able to discover how fast the radius is changing by knowing how fast the volume is changing.  Can we determine how fast the radius of the balloon is increasing  when the balloon is a certain size? We explore a scenario of this type in \hyperref[PA-3-5]{Example~\ref{PA-3-5}}.%
\begin{example}[]\label{PA-3-5}
\hypertarget{p-3585}{}%
A spherical balloon with diameter \(d\) is being inflated at a constant rate of 20 cubic inches per second.  How fast is the radius of the balloon changing at the instant the balloon's diameter is 12 inches? Is the radius changing more rapidly when \(d = 12\) or when \(d = 16\)? Why? These questions have been broken up into the following parts to guide you through the solution process.%
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-2351}{}\hypertarget{p-3586}{}%
Recall that the volume of a sphere of radius \(r\) is \(V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3\). Note that in the setting of this problem, \emph{both} \(V\) and \(r\) are changing as \(t\) (time) changes, and thus both \(V\) and \(r\) may be viewed as implicit functions of \(t\), with respective derivatives \(\frac{dV}{dt}\) and \(\frac{dr}{dt}\). Differentiate both sides of the equation \(V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3\) with respect to \(t\) to find a formula for \(\frac{dV}{dt}\) that depends on both \(r\) and \(\frac{dr}{dt}\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2352}{}\hypertarget{p-3587}{}%
By differentiating the volume function with respect to \emph{time}, we have  ``related the rates'' of change of \(V\) and \(r\). Recall that the problem statement tells us that the balloon is being inflated at a constant \emph{rate} of 20 cubic inches per second. Is this rate the value of \(\frac{dr}{dt}\) or \(\frac{dV}{dt}\)? Why?%
\item\hypertarget{li-2353}{}\hypertarget{p-3588}{}%
Note that when the diameter of the balloon is 12 inches, we know the value of the radius.  In the formula you found in (a) for \(\frac{dV}{dt}\), substitute the values we know for the relevant quantities and solve for the remaining unknown quantity. How fast is the radius changing at the instant \(d = 12\)?%
\item\hypertarget{li-2354}{}\hypertarget{p-3589}{}%
How is the situation different when \(d = 16\)? When is the radius changing more rapidly, when \(d = 12\) or when \(d = 16\)?%

\(\frac{dV}{dt}=4\pi r^2\frac{dr}{dt}.\)%
\item\hypertarget{li-2360}{}\hypertarget{p-3595}{}%
\(\frac{dV}{dt}=20\) cubic inches per second.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2361}{}\hypertarget{p-3596}{}%
\(20=4\pi (6)^2 \frac{dr}{dt},\) so \(\frac{dr}{dt}=\frac{5}{36\pi}\) inches per second when the diameter is 12 inches.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2362}{}\hypertarget{p-3597}{}%
\(\frac{dr}{dt}=\frac{5}{64\pi}\) inches per second when the diameter is 16 inches. Thus, the radius is changing more rapidly when the diameter is 12 inches.%
\end{enumerate}
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-187}{}\quad%
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-2363}{}\hypertarget{p-3598}{}%
Starting with the equation \(V=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\), we differentiate both sides with respect to \(t\). We need to use the chain rule to differentiate the right side of the equation since \(r\) is really \(r(t)\), a function of \(t\). So, the equation we have is really \(V(t)=\frac{4}{3}\pi [r(t)]^3\). Differentiating with respect to \(t\) we have%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dV}{dt}=4\pi r^2\frac{dr}{dt}.
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-2364}{}\hypertarget{p-3599}{}%
Since the units are cubic inches per second, this is a volume rate. So, \(\frac{dV}{dt}=20\) cubic inches per second.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2365}{}\hypertarget{p-3600}{}%
Since \(\frac{dV}{dt}=20\) and \(r=6\) when \(d=12\), we have \(20=4\pi(6)^2\frac{dr}{dt}\). So, \(\frac{dr}{dt}=\frac{5}{36\pi}\) inches per second.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2366}{}\hypertarget{p-3601}{}%
Doing the same thing as in part (c), we find that \(\frac{dr}{dt}=\frac{5}{64\pi}\) inches per second when the diameter is \(16\) inches (so \(r=8\)). This number is smaller than the one calculated in part (c), so the radius is changing more rapidly when the diameter is \(12\) inches. Intuitively, this makes sense since the balloon's volume is growing at a constant rate: as the balloon grows, a small change in the radius will have a larger impact on the change in volume; equivalently, the same change in volume corresponds to a smaller change in the radius when the balloon is large.%

\hypertarget{p-3602}{}%
In problems where two or more quantities can be related to one another and all of the variables involved are implicit functions of time, \(t\), we are often interested in examining how their rates are related; we call these \terminology{related rates} problems. \index{related rates} Once we have an equation establishing the relationship among the variables, we differentiate implicitly with respect to time to find connections among the rates of change.%
\begin{example}[]\label{Ex-3-5-FallingSand}
\hypertarget{p-3603}{}%
Sand is being dumped by a conveyor belt onto a pile so that the sand forms a right circular cone, as pictured below in \hyperref[F-3-5-ConeEx]{Figure~\ref{F-3-5-ConeEx}}. As sand falls from the conveyor belt, several features of the sand pile will change: the volume (\(V\)) of the pile will grow, the height (\(h\)) will increase, and the radius (\(r\)) will get bigger, too. All of these quantities are related to one another, and the rate at which each is changing is related to the rate at which sand falls from the conveyor.%

Find an equation relating the rates at which the volume, radius, and height each change with respect to time.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Hint.}\hypertarget{hint-95}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-3605}{}%
Recall that the volume of a right circular cone is%
\begin{equation*}
V=\frac13\pi r^2h\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Remember that all of \(V\), \(r\), and \(h\) are functions of \(t\). You will need the chain rule (among others) to differentiate.%

%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dV}{dt}=\frac23\pi rh\frac{dr}{dt}+\frac13\pi r^2\frac{dh}{dt}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-188}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-3607}{}%
We begin by identifying which variables are changing and how they are related. In this problem, we observe that the radius and height of the pile are related to its volume by the standard equation for the volume of a cone,%
\begin{equation*}
V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3608}{}%
Viewing each of \(V\), \(r\), and \(h\) as functions of \(t\), we differentiate implicitly to arrive at an equation that relates their respective rates of change. Taking the derivative of each side of the equation with respect to \(t\), we find%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dt}[V] = \frac{d}{dt}\left[\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\right]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3609}{}%
On the left, \(\frac{d}{dt}[V]\) is simply \(\frac{dV}{dt}\). On the right, the situation is more complicated, as both \(r\) and \(h\) are implicit functions of \(t\). Hence we need the product and chain rules. We find that\footnote{Note particularly how we are using ideas from \hyperref[sec-2-7-implicit]{Section~\ref{sec-2-7-implicit}} on implicit differentiation. There we found that when \(y\) is an implicit function of \(x\), \(\frac{d}{dx}[y^2] = 2y \frac{dy}{dx}\). The same principles are applied here when we compute \(\frac{d}{dt}[r^2] = 2r \frac{dr}{dt}\).\label{fn-37}}%
\begin{align*}
\frac{dV}{dt} &=  \frac{d}{dt}\left[\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\right]\\
&=  \frac{1}{3} \pi \frac{d}{dt}\big[r^2\big]h + \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2\frac{d}{dt}[h]\\
&=  \frac{1}{3} \pi 2r\frac{dr}{dt}h + \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3610}{}%
Thus, the equation%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{2}{3} \pi rh \frac{dr}{dt}+ \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}
\end{equation*}
relates the rates of change of \(V\), \(h\), and \(r\) with respect to time.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3611}{}%
If we are given sufficient additional information, we may then find the value of one or more of these rates of change at a specific point in time.%
\end{example}
\begin{example}[]\label{Ex-3-5-MoreSand}
\hypertarget{p-3612}{}%
In the setting of \hyperref[Ex-3-5-FallingSand]{Example~\ref{Ex-3-5-FallingSand}}, suppose we also know the following: (a) sand falls from the conveyor in such a way that the height of the pile is always half the radius, and (b) sand falls from the conveyor belt at a constant rate of 10 cubic feet per minute. How fast is the height of the sandpile changing at the moment the radius is 4 feet?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Hint.}\hypertarget{hint-96}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-3613}{}%
Use your equation from \hyperref[Ex-3-5-FallingSand]{Example~\ref{Ex-3-5-FallingSand}} that says%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dV}{dt} =  \frac{2}{3} \pi rh \frac{dr}{dt}+\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Alternatively, you may try substituting \(h=\frac12r\) into the conical volume formula \(V=\frac13\pi r^2h\) and retaking the derivative (you would not need the product rule this time, but would still need the chain rule).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Answer.}\hypertarget{answer-162}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-3614}{}%
When the radius is \(4\) feet, the height is changing at a rate of \(\frac{5}{8\pi}\approx0.199\) feet per minute.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-189}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-3615}{}%
First, we note that we want to know the value of \(\frac{dh}{dt}\) when \(r=4\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3616}{}%
The information that the height is always half the radius tells us that for all values of \(t\), \(h = \frac{1}{2}r\). Differentiating with respect to \(t\), it follows that \(\frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{dr}{dt}\). These relationships enable us to relate \(\frac{dV}{dt}\) to just one of \(r\) or \(h\). Substituting the expressions involving \(r\) and \(\frac{dr}{dt}\) for \(h\) and \(\frac{dh}{dt}\),\footnote{Note that even though we are looking for the rate at which the height changes, the information we know involves the radius, so it is easier to first solve things in terms of \(r\) and \(\frac{dr}{dt}\) and then transition back to \(\frac{dh}{dt}\). Also, observe that \textemdash{} rather than substituting expressions into the formula for \(\frac{dV}{dt}\) \textemdash{} we could instead substitute into the formula for \(V\) and recalculate the derivative. Doing so would yield \(V=\frac13\pi r^2\big(\frac12r\big)=\frac16\pi r^3\) and \(\frac{dV}{dt}=\frac12\pi r^2\frac{dr}{dt}\), which is the same relation that we have below.\label{fn-38}} we now have that%
\begin{align*}
\frac{dV}{dt}\amp=\frac23\pi rh\frac{dr}{dt}+\frac13\pi r^2\frac{dh}{dt}\\
\amp = \frac{2}{3} \pi r \left(\frac{1}{2}r \right) \frac{dr}{dt}+\frac13\pi r^2\left(\frac12\frac{dr}{dt}\right)\\
\amp=\frac12\pi r^2\frac{dr}{dt}\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3617}{}%
Since sand falls from the conveyor at the constant rate of 10 cubic feet per minute, the value of \(\frac{dV}{dt}\), the rate at which the volume of the sand pile changes, is \(\frac{dV}{dt} = 10\) ft\(^3\)/min. We are interested in how fast the height of the pile is changing at the instant when \(r = 4\), so we substitute \(r = 4\), \(\frac{dV}{dt} = 10\), and \(\frac{dr}{dt}=\left.\frac{dr}{dt}\right|_{r=4}\) into our equation above to find%
\begin{equation*}
10 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (4)^2 \left. \frac{dr}{dt} \right|_{r=4}= 8\pi \left. \frac{dr}{dt} \right|_{r=4}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3618}{}%
Only the value of \(\left. \frac{dr}{dt} \right|_{r=4}\) remains unknown;  solving, we find%
\begin{equation*}
\left. \frac{dr}{dt} \right|_{r=4} = \frac{10}{8\pi} \approx 0.39789 \ \text{ft/min}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Recall that we were interested in how fast the \emph{height} of the pile was changing at this instant, so we want to know \(\frac{dh}{dt}\) when \(r = 4\). Since \(\frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{dr}{dt}\) for all values of \(t\), it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
\left. \frac{dh}{dt} \right|_{r=4} =\frac12\left.\frac{dr}{dt}\right|_{r=4}= \frac{5}{8\pi} \approx 0.19894 \ \text{ft/min}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-3619}{}%
In \hyperref[Ex-3-5-MoreSand]{Example~\ref{Ex-3-5-MoreSand}}, it is important to note the difference between the notations \(\frac{dr}{dt}\) and \(\left. \frac{dr}{dt} \right|_{r=4}\). The former represents the rate of change of \(r\) with respect to \(t\) at an arbitrary value of \(t\), while the latter is the rate of change of \(r\) with respect to \(t\) at a particular moment, the moment when \(r = 4\).%
\par

Our work with both of the sandpile problems above is similar in many ways to our approach in \hyperref[PA-3-5]{Example~\ref{PA-3-5}}, and these steps are typical of most related rates problems.

Observe that the right triangle with legs of length \(h\) and \(r\) is \terminology{similar} to the right triangle with legs of length \(8\) and \(6\), respectively, based on how the water assumes the shape of the tank. Thus \(\frac{r}{h} = \frac{6}{8}\), so that \(r = \frac{3}{4}h\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2396}{}\hypertarget{p-3655}{}%
Since the water in the tank always takes the shape of a circular cone, the volume of water in the tank at time \(t\) is given by \(V = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h\). Because we have established that \(r = \frac{3}{4}h\), it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
V = \frac{1}{3}\pi \left( \frac{3}{4}h \right)^2 h = \frac{3}{16} \pi h^3\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-2397}{}\hypertarget{p-3656}{}%
Differentiating with respect to \(t\), we now find%
\begin{equation}
\frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{9}{16} \pi h^2 \frac{dh}{dt}\text{,}\label{watervolume}
\end{equation}
which relates the rates of change of \(V\) and \(h\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2398}{}\hypertarget{p-3657}{}%
It is given in the problem setting that water is entering the tank at a rate of 4 cubic feet per minute, hence \(\frac{dV}{dt} = 4\), and we are interested in the rate of change of the water's depth when \(h = 3\). Substituting these values into Equation~\hyperref[watervolume]{(\ref{watervolume})}, we find that%
\begin{equation*}
4 =  \frac{9}{16} \pi (3)^2 \left. \frac{dh}{dt} \right|_{h=3}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
so that \(\left. \frac{dh}{dt} \right|_{h=3} = \frac{64}{81\pi} \approx 0.2515\) feet per minute.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2399}{}\hypertarget{p-3658}{}%
Note that we can solve Equation~\hyperref[watervolume]{(\ref{watervolume})} for \(\frac{dh}{dt}\). Doing so with the substitution of the constant rate \(\frac{dV}{dt}=4\), we find that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dh}{dt}=\frac{64}{9\pi h^2}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
so \(\frac{dh}{dt}\) is inversely proportional to \(h^2\). In other words, \(\frac{dh}{dt}\) will be decreasing as \(h^2\) increases (which is when \(h\) increases, since \(h\gt0\)). Thus, the water is rising faster at a depth of 3 feet than at a depth of 4 or 5 feet. We can also see this by calculating \(h'(4)\) and \(h'(5)\) and comparing these values to our answer from (e).%

Recognizing which geometric relationships are relevant in a given problem is often the key to finding the function to optimize. For instance, although the problem in \hyperref[act-3-5-1]{Example~\ref{act-3-5-1}} is about a conical tank, the most important fact is that there are two similar right triangles involved. In another setting, we might use the Pythagorean Theorem to relate the legs of the triangle. But in the conical tank, the fact that the water fills the tank so that that the ratio of radius to depth is constant turns out to be the important relationship. In other situations where a changing angle is involved, trigonometric functions may provide the means to find relationships among various parts of the triangle.%

A television camera is positioned 4000 feet from the base of a rocket launching pad. The angle of elevation of the camera has to change at the correct rate in order to keep the rocket in sight. In addition, the auto-focus of the camera has to take into account the increasing distance between the camera and the rocket. We assume that the rocket rises vertically.\footnote{A similar problem is discussed and pictured dynamically at \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/9t}{http://gvsu.edu/s/9t}.

To relate \(\theta\) and \(h\), observe that the tangent function is a good choice since \(\tan(\theta) = \frac{h}{4000}\), so that%
\begin{equation*}
h = 4000 \tan(\theta)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Differentiating implicitly with respect to \(t\), we find that%
\begin{equation}
\frac{dh}{dt} = 4000 \sec^2 (\theta) \frac{d\theta}{dt}\text{.}\label{rocketanglerates}
\end{equation}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-2417}{}\hypertarget{p-3680}{}%
To relate \(z\) and \(h\), the Pythagorean Theorem is natural to consider. This tells us%
\begin{equation*}
h^2 + (4000)^2 = z^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Differentiating both sides implicitly with respect to \(t\), it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
2h \frac{dh}{dt} = 2z \frac{dz}{dt}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and thus%
\begin{equation}
h \frac{dh}{dt} = z \frac{dz}{dt}\text{.}\label{rocketrates}
\end{equation}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-2418}{}\hypertarget{p-3681}{}%
Using the given fact that the rocket's speed is 600 ft/sec at the instant it has risen 3000 feet, we know that \(\left. \frac{dh}{dt} \right|_{h=3000} = 600\). Note further in the triangle that when \(h = 3000\), use of the Pythagorean Theorem yields \(z=5000\). Substituting this information  into Equation~\hyperref[rocketrates]{(\ref{rocketrates})} from (c), we find that%
\begin{equation*}
3000 \cdot 600 = 5000 \cdot \left. \frac{dz}{dt} \right|_{h=3000}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Solving for \(\left. \frac{dz}{dt} \right|_{h=3000}\) gives us%
\begin{equation*}
\left. \frac{dz}{dt} \right|_{h=3000} = \frac{1800}{5} = 360 \ \text{feet/sec}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
To answer the question about how fast the camera angle is changing, we use the same information but now in Equation~\hyperref[rocketanglerates]{(\ref{rocketanglerates})}, from (b).  Observe that when \(h = 3000\),  it follows that \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{4}{5}\), so \(\sec(\theta) = \frac{5}{4}\). Thus%
\begin{equation*}
600 = 4000 \cdot \frac{25}{16} \left. \frac{d\theta}{dt} \right|_{h=3000}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and hence%
\begin{equation*}
\left. \frac{d\theta}{dt} \right|_{h=3000} = \frac{6 \cdot 16}{40 \cdot 25} = \frac{12}{125} \ \text{radians per second}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-2419}{}\hypertarget{p-3682}{}%
Recalling that \(h \frac{dh}{dt} = z \frac{dz}{dt}\), it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{h}{z} \frac{dh}{dt}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Using this equation when \(h = 3000\) and \(\frac{dh}{dt} = 600\) led us to conclude that \(\left. \frac{dz}{dt} \right|_{h=3000} = \frac{3}{5} \cdot 600 = 360\) feet/sec. If we instead use \(h = 4000\), it follows that \(z = 4000\sqrt{2}\), so that%
\begin{equation*}
\left. \frac{dz}{dt} \right|_{h=4000} = \frac{4}{4\sqrt{2}} \cdot 600 \approx 424.26 \ \text{feet/sec}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Indeed, \(\frac{dz}{dt}\) is an increasing function of \(h\) \textemdash{} provided that \(\frac{dh}{dt}\) is constant \textemdash{} because we can write \(z = \sqrt{h^2 + 4000^2}\), making%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{h}{\sqrt{h^2 + 4000^2}} \frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{h}{\sqrt{h^2 + 4000^2}} 600\text{.}
\end{equation*}
It is straightforward to verify that \(\frac{h}{\sqrt{h^2 + 4000^2}}\) is an increasing function of \(h\); hence any constant multiple of it is as well.%
\end{enumerate}
%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-3683}{}%
In addition to finding instantaneous rates of change at particular points in time, we can often make more general observations about how particular rates themselves will change over time. For instance, when a conical tank is filling with water at a constant rate, it seems obvious that the depth of the water should increase more slowly over time. Note how carefully we must phrase the relationship: we mean to say that while the depth, \(h\), of the water is increasing, its rate of change, \(\frac{dh}{dt}\), is decreasing (both as a function of \(t\) and as a function of \(h\)). We make this observation by solving the equation that relates the various rates for one particular rate, without substituting any particular values for known variables or rates. For instance, in the conical tank problem in \hyperref[act-3-5-1]{Example~\ref{act-3-5-1}}, we established that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{9}{16} \pi h^2 \frac{dh}{dt}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and hence%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{16}{9\pi h^2} \frac{dV}{dt}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3684}{}%
Provided that \(\frac{dV}{dt}\) is constant, it is immediately apparent that as \(h\) gets larger, \(\frac{dh}{dt}\) will get smaller but remain positive. Hence, the depth of the water is increasing at a decreasing rate.%

The two right triangles shown in the diagram in (a) are similar: the small triangle is formed by the skateboarder and his shadow, and has legs of length \(6\) and \(s\); the large triangle is formed by the lampost and the distance from the post to the shadow's tip, and has legs of length \(15\) and \(x+s\). Similarity gives us that the ratios of leg lengths are equal, so we have%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{s}{6} = \frac{s+x}{15}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Simplifying yields \(15s = 6s + 6x\), or%
\begin{equation*}
3s = 2x\text{.}

%
\item\hypertarget{li-2440}{}\hypertarget{p-3708}{}%
Differentiating with respect to \(t\), it is immediate that%

3 \frac{ds}{dt} = 2\frac{dx}{dt}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-2441}{}\hypertarget{p-3709}{}%
Since \(\frac{ds}{dt} = \frac{2}{3} \frac{dx}{dt}\), and \(\frac{dx}{dt} = 3\), it follows that \(\frac{ds}{dt} = 2\) for every value of \(t\) (and \(x\)). Thus, \(\left. \frac{ds}{dt} \right|_{x=8} = 2\) feet per second.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2442}{}\hypertarget{p-3710}{}%
Because \(\frac{ds}{dt}\) is constant, the shadow's length is increasing at a constant rate (irrespective of the distance from the skateboarder to the lamppost).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2443}{}\hypertarget{p-3711}{}%
Let \(y\) represent the location of the tip of the shadow, so that \(y = x + s\). Observe that we can now compute \(\frac{dy}{dt}\) in terms of \(\frac{dx}{dt}\) and \(\frac{ds}{dt}\), with%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{ds}{dt} = 3 + 2 = 5
\end{equation*}
feet per second, and hence the tip of the shadow is moving more rapidly than the skateboarder himself.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3712}{}%
Even though the shadow's length is growing slower than the skateboarder is moving, the tip of the shadow is moving both due to growth and due to the skateboarder's movement, giving us the faster rate.%

By the Pythagorean Theorem, we know that \(x^2 + 90^2 = z^2\); differentiating with respect to \(t\), we have%

\hypertarget{p-3722}{}%
At the instant the ball is halfway to third base, we know \(x = 45\) and \(\left. \frac{dx}{dt} \right|_{x = 45} = 100\). Moreover, by Pythagoras, \(z^2 = 90^2 + 45^2\), so \(z = 45\sqrt{5}\). Thus,%
\begin{align*}
\left.\frac{dz}{dt}\right|_{x=45}=\mathstrut\amp\left.\left(\frac xz\frac{dx}{dt}\right)\right|_{x=45}\\

In addition, at this same instant we know that \(\left. \frac{dx}{dt} \right|_{x = 45} = 100\) and \(\left. \frac{dr}{dt} \right|_{x = 45} = 30\). Applying this information, we end up with%

When two or more related quantities are changing as implicit functions of time, their rates of change can be related by implicitly differentiating the equation that relates the quantities themselves. For instance, if the sides of a right triangle are all changing as functions of time, say having lengths \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\), then these quantities are related by the Pythagorean Theorem: \(x^2 + y^2 = z^2\). It follows by implicitly differentiating with respect to \(t\) that their rates are related by the equation%
\begin{equation*}
2x \frac{dx}{dt} + 2y\frac{dy}{dt} = 2z \frac{dz}{dt}\text{,}

As pictured, we know that \(5\) is the vertical height from the pulley to the level of the bow of the boat, and we let \(z\) be the length of the rope from the pulley to the bow of the boat, and \(x\) the horizontal distance from the dock to the bow of the boat.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3732}{}%
We are given that the rope is being pulled in at \(2\) feet per second, and thus \(\frac{dz}{dt} = -2\) feet per second. Because we want to know how fast the boat is approaching the dock when the length of rope from bow to pulley is 13 feet, we want to know \(\left. \frac{dx}{dt} \right|_{z=13}\). Thus, we need to relate the changing quantities \(z\) and \(x\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3733}{}%
Because the rope, the post (vertically extended), and the horizontal distance from the bow of the boat to the post on the dock form a right triangle at all times, it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
x^2 + 5^2 = z^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Having now related \(z\) and \(x\), we differentiate this equation with respect to \(t\). By the chain rule, we now see that%
\begin{equation*}
2x \frac{dx}{dt} = 2z \frac{dz}{dt}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
At the instant \(z = 13\), \(x^2 + 5^2 = 13^2\), and thus \(x = 12\). Using all of the given information at the instant \(z = 13\) (including that \(\frac{dz}{dt} = -2\)),%
\begin{equation*}
2(12) \left. \frac{dx}{dt} \right|_{z = 13} = 2(13)(-2)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Solving for \(\left. \frac{dx}{dt} \right|_{z = 13}\),%
\begin{equation*}
\left. \frac{dx}{dt} \right|_{z = 13} = -\frac{13}{6}
\end{equation*}
feet per second. Thus the boat is approaching the dock at a rate of \(\frac{13}{6} \approx 2.167\) feet per second.%

The variables in this problem are the volume \(V\) of water in the pool and the depth \(y\) of water in the pool (measured at the deepest point of the pool); each is implicitly a function of time, \(t\). We are given that \(\frac{dV}{dt}\) is a constant \(800\) cubic feet per minute and want to find \(\frac{dh}{dt}\bigm|_{h=5}\). To do this, we first need to relate \(V\) and \(h\). The volume of the water in the pool at height \(h \lt 12\) is the volume of the triangular cross sectional area of height \(h\) (as shown in the figure below) times the width (25 feet) of the pool. The height of the triangular cross section is \(h\) and the length is distance of the dotted line indicated in the figure.%

This line has slope \(\frac{12}{60} = 0.2\) and \(y\)-intercept \((0,-15)\). So the equation of this line is \(y = 0.2x-15\). It is the \(x\) coordinate of the point on this line corresponding to the \(y\)-coordinate \(h-15\) that is the length of the triangle whose height is \(h\). So the length \(l\) is \(l = \frac{(h-15)+15}{0.2} = 5h\). Thus, the volume of water in the pool at height \(h\) is%
\begin{equation*}
V = \left(\frac{1}{2}(h)(5h)\right)(25) = 62.5h^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Both \(V\) and \(h\) are functions of time. Differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to  \(t\) gives%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dV}{dt} = 62.5(2h) \frac{dh}{dt}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
so%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{1}{125h} \frac{dV}{dt}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
When the depth of water in the pool is \(5\) feet, then the depth is increasing at the rate%
\begin{equation*}
\left. \frac{dh}{dt}\right|_{h = 5} = \frac{1}{125(5)} (800) = 1.28
\end{equation*}
feet per minute. Since \(\frac{dh}{dt}\) is inversely proportional to \(h\), the rate at which the depth of the water increases slows as \(h\) increases, so the depth of the water is increasing at a decreasing rate.%

Each of \(x\), \(z\), and \(\theta\) is implicitly a function of \(t\). We are given that the runner is advancing at a rate of \(24\) feet per second, so \(\frac{dx}{dt} = -24\). Since we want to know \(\left. \frac{d\theta}{dt} \right|_{x = 30}\), we want to relate \(x\) and \(\theta\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3743}{}%
We first observe that by definition,%
\begin{equation*}
\tan(\theta) = \frac{x}{90} = \frac{1}{90}x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Having related \(x\) and \(\theta\), we can differentiate both sides of the preceding equation with respect  to \(t\). By the chain rule,%
\begin{equation*}
\sec^2 (\theta) \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{1}{90} \frac{dx}{dt}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and thus%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{1}{90 \sec^2 (\theta)} \frac{dx}{dt}
\end{equation*}
At the instant \(x = 30\), since \(x^2 + 90^2 = z^2\), \(z = \sqrt{90^2 + 30^2} = \sqrt{9000} = 30\sqrt{10}\). Hence, at this same instance, \(\sec(\theta) = \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)} = \frac{30\sqrt{10}}{90} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{3}\). Recall we also know that \(\frac{dx}{dt} = -24\). Applying this information to the equation that relates the rates of change of \(x\) and \(\theta\),%
\begin{equation*}
\left. \frac{d\theta}{dt} \right|_{x = 30} = \frac{1}{90 \left( \frac{\sqrt{10}}{3} \right)^2} (-24) = -\frac{1}{100}(24) = -0.24

Sand is being dumped off a conveyor belt onto a pile in such a way that the pile forms in the shape of a cone whose radius is always equal to its height. Assuming that the sand is being dumped at a rate of \(10\) cubic feet per minute, how fast is the height of the pile changing when there are \(1000\) cubic feet on the pile?%

\hypertarget{p-3745}{}%
\(\left. \frac{dh}{dt}\right|_{V=1000} = \frac{10}{\pi \left( \sqrt[3]{\frac{3000}{\pi}} \right)^2} \approx 0.0328\) feet per minute.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-197}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-3746}{}%
We can draw a figure similar to \hyperref[F-3-5-ConeEx]{Figure~\ref{F-3-5-ConeEx}} and let \(h\) be the height of the pile at time \(t\) and \(r\) the pile's base radius. Given that \(\frac{dV}{dt} = 10\) cubic feet per minute, we want to know \(\left. \frac{dh}{dt} \right|_{V = 1000}\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3747}{}%
We first relate \(V\) and \(h\). We know that \(V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), as well as that for every time, \(t\), the height and radius are equal so \(r = h\). Thus,%
\begin{equation*}
V =  \frac{1}{3} \pi h^2 h =  \frac{1}{3} \pi h^3
\end{equation*}
Differentiating both sides of this equation with respect to \(t\)%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{1}{3} \pi \cdot 3h^2 \frac{dh}{dt} = \pi h^2 \frac{dh}{dt}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
We note that at the instant \(V = 1000\), \(1000 = \frac{1}{3} \pi h^3\), so \(h^3 = \frac{3000}{\pi}\) and therefore \(h = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3000}{\pi}}\). Recall also that \(\frac{dV}{dt} = 10\). Applying all of this information at the instant \(V = 1000\) in the equation that relates \(\frac{dV}{dt}\) and \(\frac{dh}{dt}\), we have%
\begin{equation*}
10 = \pi \left( \sqrt[3]{\frac{3000}{\pi}} \right)^2 \left. \frac{dh}{dt}\right|_{V=1000}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Thus,%
\begin{equation*}
\left. \frac{dh}{dt}\right|_{V=1000} = \frac{10}{\pi \left( \sqrt[3]{\frac{3000}{\pi}} \right)^2} \approx 0.0328
\end{equation*}

How can derivatives assist us in evaluating indeterminate limits of the form \(\frac{\infty}{\infty}\)?%
\end{itemize}
\end{objectives}
\hypertarget{p-3751}{}%
\index{limit!indeterminate form} Because differential calculus is based on the definition of the derivative, and the definition of the derivative involves a limit, there is a sense in which all of calculus rests on limits. Limits in which separately evaluating the numerator and denominator at the limit point results in the fraction \(\frac{0}{0}\) are called \terminology{indeterminate form}. When we come across a limit like this, we have some work to do. Remember, saying that a limit has an indeterminate form only means that we don't yet know its value and have more work to do: indeed, limits of the form \(\frac{0}{0}\) can take on any value.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3752}{}%
We have learned many techniques for evaluating the limits that arise from applying the definition of the derivative, including a large number of shortcut rules that seem to bypass the use of limits entirely. In this section, we will explore how to use derivatives to evaluate certain limits that we previously could not compute.%
\begin{example}[]\label{PA-2-8}

\item\hypertarget{li-2449}{}\hypertarget{p-3755}{}%
Next we will investigate the behavior of both the numerator and denominator of \(h\) near the point where \(x = 1\). Let \(f(x) = x^5 + x - 2\) and \(g(x) = x^2 - 1\). Find the local linearizations of \(f\) and \(g\) at \(a = 1\), and call these functions \(L_f(x)\) and \(L_g(x)\), respectively.%

\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
\item\hypertarget{li-2463}{}\hypertarget{p-3769}{}%
Since \(f(x)=x^5+x-2\), we have \(f(1)=1+1-2=0\). Likewise, \(g(x)=x^2-1\), so \(g(1)=1-1=0\). As both \(f(1)=0\) and \(g(1)=0\), we can \emph{not} say ``\(\lim\limits_{x\to1}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\frac{f(1)}{g(1)}\),'' because the right side of this equation is not a well-defined number. If only the denominator were \(0\), we could say the limit was infinite; if only the numerator were \(0\), we could say the limit was also \(0\). Instead, we are left with an indeterminate form of \(\frac00\), which could be zero or infinite or anywhere in between.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2464}{}\hypertarget{p-3770}{}%
Recall that the local linearization of a function \(y(x)\) at a point \(x=a\) is given by the formula%
\begin{equation*}
L_y(x)=y'(a)(x-a)+y(a)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Since \(f(1)=0\) and \(f'(x)=5x^4+1\), then \(f'(1)=6\) and%
\begin{equation*}
L_f(x)=6(x-1)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Since \(g(1)=0\) and \(g'(x)=2x\), then \(g'(1)=2\) and%
\begin{equation*}
L_g(x)=2(x-1)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-2465}{}\hypertarget{p-3771}{}%
\(L_f\) and \(L_g\) are the tangent line approximations for \(f\) and \(g\), respectively, near the point \(x=1\). Because \(f\) and \(g\) are each differentiable and hence locally linear, this means \(L_f(x)\approx f(x)\) for \(x\) near \(1\), and \(L_g(x)\approx g(x)\) for \(x\) near \(1\). Thus for values of \(x\) that are close to \(1\) and are not roots of \(g(x)\), we can approximate the quotient \(h(x)=\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\) by \(\frac{L_f(x)}{L_g(x)}\). Finally, since the only roots of \(g\) are \(\pm1\), we can thus say: for \(x\neq1\) near \(a=1\),%
\begin{equation*}
h(x)\approx\frac{L_f(x)}{L_g(x)}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-2466}{}\hypertarget{p-3772}{}%
Notice that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x\to1}\frac{L_f(x)}{L_g(x)}=\lim_{x\to1}\frac{6(x-1)}{2(x-1)}=\lim_{x\to1}\frac62=3\text{.}
\end{equation*}
By our argument in (c), we know \(h(x)\approx\frac{L_f(x)}{L_g(x)}\) near \(x=1\). It should thus be the case that \(\lim\limits_{x\to1}h(x)=\lim\limits_{x\to1}\frac{L_f(x)}{L_g(x)}=3\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2467}{}\hypertarget{p-3773}{}%
Looking at a graph of \(y=h(x)\), we note that there is a hole at \((1,3)\), implying that \(x=1\) is a removable discontinuity, and \(\lim\limits_{x\to1}h(x)=3\). With a numerical approach, we see that \(h(0.99)\approx2.965\), \(h(0.999)\approx2.997\), \(h(1.01)\approx3.035\), and \(h(1.001)\approx3.0035\). These values again suggest that \(\lim\limits_{h\to1}h(x)=3\). Finally, we note that \(h\) is a rational function and that \(1\) is a root of both its numerator and its denominator. It follows that \(x-1\) is a factor of both the numerator and denominator, and in fact%
\begin{equation*}
h(x)=\frac{(x^4+x^3+x^2+x+2)(x-1)}{(x+1)(x-1)}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Hence, we can actually compute \(\lim\limits_{x\to1}h(x)\) algebraically (even though it wasn't clear before that we could), and thus confirm that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x\to1}h(x)=\lim_{x\to1}\frac{(x^4+x^3+x^2+x+2)}{(x+1)}=\frac62=3\text{.}
\end{equation*}

\subsection[{Using Derivatives to Evaluate Indeterminate Limits of the Form \(\frac{0}{0}\)}]{Using Derivatives to Evaluate Indeterminate Limits of the Form \(\frac{0}{0}\)}\label{subsection-95}
\hypertarget{p-3774}{}%
The idea demonstrated in \hyperref[PA-2-8]{Example~\ref{PA-2-8}} \textemdash{} that we can evaluate an indeterminate limit of the form \(\frac{0}{0}\) by replacing each of the numerator and denominator with their local linearizations at the point of interest \textemdash{} can be generalized in a way that enables us to evaluate a wide range of limits. Given a function \(h(x)\) that can be written as a quotient \(h(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\), where \(f\) and \(g\) are both differentiable at \(x=a\) and for which \(f(a) = g(a) = 0\), we would like to evaluate the indeterminate limit given by \(\lim\limits_{x \to a} h(x)\). Below, \hyperref[F-2-8-LHR]{Figure~\ref{F-2-8-LHR}} illustrates this situation.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/2_8_LHR.pdf}
\caption{At left, the graphs of \(f\) and \(g\) near the value \(a\), along with their tangent line approximations \(L_f\) and \(L_g\) at \(x = a\).  At right, we zoom in on the point \(a\) and the four graphs.\label{F-2-8-LHR}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-3775}{}%
In this figure, we see that both \(f\) and \(g\) have an \(x\)-intercept at \(x = a\). Their respective tangent line approximations \(L_f\) and \(L_g\) at \(x = a\) are also shown in the figure. We can take advantage of the fact that a differentiable function and its tangent line approximation become indistinguishable as \(x\) approaches \(a\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3776}{}%
First, let's recall that the local linearizations of \(f\) and \(g\) at \(x=a\) are, respectively, \(L_f(x) = f'(a)(x-a) + f(a)\) and \(L_g(x) = g'(a)(x-a) +g(a)\). Because \(x\) is getting arbitrarily close to \(a\) when we take the limit, we can replace \(f\) with \(L_f\) and replace \(g\) with \(L_g\), and thus we observe that%
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} =\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to a} \frac{L_f(x)}{L_g(x)}\\
=\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(a)(x-a) + f(a)}{g'(a)(x-a) + g(a)}\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3777}{}%
Next, we remember that both \(f(a) = 0\) and \(g(a) = 0\), which is precisely what makes the original limit indeterminate. Substituting these values for \(f(a)\) and \(g(a)\) in the limit above, we now have%
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} =\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(a)(x-a)}{g'(a)(x-a)}\\
=\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}\text{,}
\end{align*}
where the latter equality holds because \(\frac{x-a}{x-a} = 1\) when \(x\) is approaching (but not equal to) \(a\). Finally, we note that \(\frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}\) is constant with respect to \(x\), and thus%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3778}{}%
This result holds as long as \(g'(a)\) is not equal to zero. The formal name of the result is L'Hopital's Rule.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3779}{}%
\begin{assemblage}[L'Hopital's Rule]\label{assemblage-89}
\hypertarget{p-3780}{}%
Let \(f\) and \(g\) be differentiable at \(x=a\), and suppose that \(f(a) = g(a) = 0\) and that \(g'(a) \neq 0\). Then%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)}.
\end{equation*}
%
\end{assemblage}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3781}{}%
In practice, we typically work with a slightly more general version of L'Hopital's Rule, \index{L'Hopital's rule} which states that (under the identical assumptions as the boxed rule above and the extra assumption that \(g'\) is continuous at \(x=a\))%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
provided the righthand limit exists. This form reflects the basic idea of L'Hopital's Rule: if \(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\) produces an indeterminate limit of form \(\frac{0}{0}\) as \(x\) tends to \(a\), that limit is equivalent to the limit of the quotient of the two functions' derivatives, \(\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3782}{}%
For example, we can revisit the limit from \hyperref[PA-2-8]{Example~\ref{PA-2-8}}:%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^5 + x - 2}{x^2 - 1}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Applying L'Hopital's Rule to this limit, we again see that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^5 + x - 2}{x^2 - 1} = \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{5x^4 + 1}{2x} = \frac{6}{2} = 3. \\
\end{equation*}
As was the case here, by replacing the numerator and denominator with their respective derivatives, we often replace an indeterminate limit with one whose value we can easily determine.%

\item\hypertarget{li-2480}{}\hypertarget{p-3799}{}%
As \(x\) tends to \(0\), we see that \(\ln(1+x)\) approaches \(\ln(1) = 0\), thus this limit has an indeterminate form. By L'Hopital's Rule, we have%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\ln(1 + x)}{x} = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\big(\frac{1}{1 + x}\big)}{1}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
As this limit is no longer indeterminate, we may simply allow \(x\) to go to \(0\), and thus we find that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\ln(1 + x)}{x} = \frac{\big(\frac{1}{1 + 0}\big)}{1} = 1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-2481}{}\hypertarget{p-3800}{}%
Observe that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to \pi} \frac{\cos(x)}{x} = \frac{\cos(\pi)}{\pi} = -\frac{1}{\pi}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
This limit is not indeterminate because the function \(\frac{\cos(x)}{x}\) is continuous at \(x = \pi\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2482}{}\hypertarget{p-3801}{}%
Since \(\ln(x)\) goes to \(0\) and \(e^{x-1}\) goes to \(1\) as \(x\) approaches \(1\), this limit is indeterminate with form \(\frac{0}{0}\). Hence, by L'Hopital's Rule,%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{2 \ln(x)}{1-e^{x-1}} = \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{\big(\frac{2}{x}\big)}{-e^{x-1}}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
The updated limit is not indeterminate, so we allow \(x\) to approach \(1\) and find%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{2 \ln(x)}{1-e^{x-1}} = \frac{\big(\frac{2}{1}\big)}{-e^{0}} = -2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-2483}{}\hypertarget{p-3802}{}%
Since the given limit is indeterminate of form \(\frac{0}{0}\), by L'Hopital's Rule we have%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x) - x}{\cos(2x)-1} =  \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\cos(x) - 1}{-2\sin(2x)}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Now, as \(x\) nears \(0\), we see that \(\cos(x)\) approaches \(1\) and \(\sin(2x)\) tends to \(0\), which makes the latest limit also indeterminate in form \(\frac{0}{0}\). Applying L'Hopital's Rule a second time, we now have%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x) - x}{\cos(2x)-1} =  \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{-\sin(x)}{-4\cos(2x)}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
In the newest limit, we note that \(\sin(x)\) tends to \(0\) but \(\cos(2x)\) tends to \(1\) as \(x\) approaches \(0\), so the numerator is tending to 0 while the denominator is approaching \(-4\). Thus, the value of the limit is determined to be%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x) - x}{\cos(2x)-1} =  0\text{.}
\end{equation*}

\hypertarget{p-3803}{}%
While L'Hopital's Rule can be applied in an entirely algebraic way, it is important to remember that the justification of the rule is graphical: the main idea is that the slopes of the tangent lines to \(f\) and \(g\) at \(x = a\) determine the value of the limit of \(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\) as \(x\) tends to \(a\). We see this in \hyperref[F-2-8-LHR2]{Figure~\ref{F-2-8-LHR2}} below, where we can see from the grid that \(f'(a) = 2\) and \(g'(a) = -1\),\footnote{This is assuming that the grid has a \(1\times1\) scale, which is not clear from the diagram. In fact, as long as the scales on the two axes in \hyperref[F-2-8-LHR2]{Figure~\ref{F-2-8-LHR2}} are the same (but not necessarily having one unit per box), then the ratio of \(f'(a)\) and \(g'(a)\) will be \(-2\) as stated below. In general though, it is always important to be sure of the scale of a graph before assuming that ``of course it's a \(1\times1\) grid,'' because that will not always be the case.\label{fn-41}} hence by L'Hopital's Rule,%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to a}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{f'(a)}{g'(a)} = \frac{2}{-1} = -2\text{.}
\end{equation*}

\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-3804}{}%
It's not the fact that \(f\) and \(g\) both approach zero that matters most, but rather the \emph{rate} at which each approaches zero that determines the value of the limit. This is a good way to remember what L'Hopital's Rule says: if \(f(a) = g(a) = 0\), the the limit of \(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\) is given by the ratio of the slopes of \(f\) and \(g\) at \(x = a\).%

\hypertarget{p-3822}{}%
The concept of infinity, \index{infinity} denoted \(\infty\), arises naturally in calculus, as it does in much of mathematics. It is important to note from the outset that \(\infty\) is a concept, but not a number itself. Indeed, the notion of \(\infty\) naturally invokes the idea of limits. Consider, for example, the function \(f(x) = \frac{1}{x}\), whose graph is pictured in \hyperref[F-2-8-Infty]{Figure~\ref{F-2-8-Infty}}.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3823}{}%
We note that \(x = 0\) is not in the domain of \(f\), so we may naturally wonder what happens as \(x \to 0\). As \(x \to 0^+\), we observe that \(f(x)\) \emph{increases without bound}. That is, we can make the value of \(f(x)\) as large as we like by taking \(x\) closer and closer (but not equal) to 0, while keeping \(x \gt 0\). This is a good way to think about what infinity represents: a quantity is tending to infinity if there is no single number that the quantity is always less than.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.47\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/2_8_Infty.pdf}
\caption{The graph of \(f(x) = \frac{1}{x}\).\label{F-2-8-Infty}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-3824}{}%
Recall that the statement \(\lim\limits_{x \to a} f(x) = L\), means that can make \(f(x)\) as close to \(L\) as we'd like by taking \(x\) sufficiently close (but not equal) to \(a\). We now expand this notation and language to include the possibility that either \(L\) or \(a\) can be \(\infty\). For instance, for \(f(x) = \frac{1}{x}\), we now write%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{1}{x} = \infty\text{,}
\end{equation*}
by which we mean that we can make \(\frac{1}{x}\) as large as we like by taking \(x\) sufficiently close (but not equal) to 0. In a similar way, we write%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{x} = 0\text{,}
\end{equation*}
since we can make \(\frac{1}{x}\) as close to 0 as we'd like by taking \(x\) sufficiently large (i.e., by letting \(x\) increase without bound).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3825}{}%
In general, the notation \(\lim\limits_{x \to a} f(x) = \infty\) means that we can make \(f(x)\) as large as we like by taking \(x\) sufficiently close (but not equal) to \(a\), and the notation \(\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} f(x) = L\)  means that we can make \(f(x)\) as close to \(L\) as we like by taking \(x\) sufficiently large. This notation also applies to left- and right-hand limits, and to limits involving \(-\infty\). For example, returning to \hyperref[F-2-8-Infty]{Figure~\ref{F-2-8-Infty}} and \(f(x) = \frac{1}{x}\), we can say that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to 0^-} \frac{1}{x} = -\infty \ \ \text{and}  \ \ \lim_{x \to -\infty} \frac{1}{x} = 0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3826}{}%
Finally, we write%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = \infty
\end{equation*}
if we can make the value of \(f(x)\) as large as we'd like by taking \(x\) sufficiently large. For example,%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to \infty} x^2 = \infty\text{.}
\end{equation*}

\hypertarget{p-3827}{}%
Limits involving infinity identify \terminology{vertical} and \terminology{horizontal asymptotes} \index{asymptote} \index{asymptote!vertical} \index{asymptote!horizontal} of a function. If \(\lim\limits_{x \to a} f(x) = \infty\), then \(x = a\) is a vertical asymptote of \(f\), while if \(\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} f(x) = L\), then \(y = L\) is a horizontal asymptote of \(f\). Similar statements can be made using \(-\infty\), and with left- and right-hand limits as \(x \to a^-\) or \(x \to a^+\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3828}{}%
In precalculus classes, it is common to study the \terminology{end behavior} of certain families of functions, by which we mean the behavior of a function as \(x \to \infty\) and as \(x \to -\infty\). Here we briefly examine some familiar functions and note the values of several limits involving \(\infty\).%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/2_8_InftyLib.pdf}
\caption{Graphs of some familiar functions whose end behavior as \(x \to \pm \infty\) is known.  In the middle graph, \(f(x) = x^3 - 16x\) and \(g(x) = x^4 - 16x^2 - 8\).\label{F-2-8-InftyLib}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-3829}{}%
For the natural exponential function \(e^x\), we note that \(\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} e^x = \infty\) and \(\lim\limits_{x \to -\infty} e^x = 0\). For the exponential decay function \(e^{-x}\), these limits are reversed, with \(\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} e^{-x} = 0\) and \(\lim\limits_{x \to -\infty} e^{-x} = \infty\). Turning to the natural logarithm function, we have \(\lim\limits_{x \to 0^+} \ln(x) = -\infty\) and \(\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} \ln(x) = \infty\). While both \(e^x\) and \(\ln(x)\) grow without bound as \(x \to \infty\), the exponential function does so much more quickly than the logarithm function does. We'll soon use limits to quantify what we mean by ``quickly.''%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3830}{}%
For polynomial functions of the form%
\begin{equation*}
p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots a_1 x + a_0\text{,}
\end{equation*}
the end behavior depends on the sign of \(a_n\) and whether the highest power \(n\) is even or odd. If \(n\) is even and \(a_n\) is positive, then \(\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} p(x) = \infty\) and \(\lim\limits_{x \to -\infty} p(x) = \infty\), as in the plot of \(g\) in \hyperref[F-2-8-InftyLib]{Figure~\ref{F-2-8-InftyLib}}. If instead \(a_n\) is negative, then \(\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} p(x) = -\infty\) and \(\lim\limits_{x \to -\infty} p(x) = -\infty\). In the situation where \(n\) is odd, then either \(\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} p(x) = \infty\) and \(\lim\limits_{x \to -\infty} p(x) = -\infty\) (which occurs when \(a_n\) is positive, as in the graph of \(f\) in \hyperref[F-2-8-InftyLib]{Figure~\ref{F-2-8-InftyLib}}), or \(\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} p(x) = -\infty\) and \(\lim\limits_{x \to -\infty} p(x) = \infty\) (when \(a_n\) is negative).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3831}{}%
A function can fail to have a limit as \(x \to \infty\). For example, consider the plot of the sine function at right in \hyperref[F-2-8-InftyLib]{Figure~\ref{F-2-8-InftyLib}}. Because the function continues oscillating between \(-1\) and \(1\) as \(x \to \infty\), we say that \(\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} \sin(x)\) does not exist.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3832}{}%
Finally, it is straightforward to analyze the behavior of any rational function as \(x \to \infty\).%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-167}
\hypertarget{p-3833}{}%
Determine the limit of the function%
\begin{equation*}
q(x) =  \frac{3x^2 - 4x + 5}{7x^2 + 9x - 10}
\end{equation*}
as \(x \to \infty\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3834}{}%
Note that both \((3x^2 - 4x + 5) \to \infty\) as \(x \to \infty\) and \((7x^2 + 9x - 10) \to \infty\) as \(x \to \infty\). Here we say that \(\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} q(x)\) has indeterminate form \(\frac{\infty}{\infty}\). We can determine the value of this limit through a standard algebraic approach. Multiplying the numerator and denominator each by \(\frac{1}{x^2}\), we find that%
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x \to \infty} q(x) =\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{3x^2 - 4x + 5}{7x^2 + 9x - 10} \cdot \frac{\frac{1}{x^2}}{\frac{1}{x^2}}\\
=\mathstrut \amp  \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{3 - 4\frac{1}{x} + 5\frac{1}{x^2}}{7 + 9\frac{1}{x} - 10\frac{1}{x^2}} = \frac{3}{7}
\end{align*}
since \(\frac{1}{x^2} \to 0\) and \(\frac{1}{x} \to 0\) as \(x \to \infty\). This shows that the rational function \(q\) has a horizontal asymptote at \(y = \frac{3}{7}\). A similar approach can be used to determine the limit of any rational function as \(x \to \infty\).%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-3835}{}%
But how should we handle a limit such as%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2}{e^x}?
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3836}{}%
Here, both \(x^2 \to \infty\) and \(e^x \to \infty\), but there is not an obvious algebraic approach that enables us to find the limit's value. Fortunately, it turns out that L'Hopital's Rule extends to cases involving infinity.%
\par

\begin{assemblage}[L'Hopital's Rule (\(\infty\))]\label{assemblage-90}
\hypertarget{p-3838}{}%
If \(f\) and \(g\) are differentiable and both approach zero or both approach \(\pm \infty\) as \(x \to a\) (where \(a\) is allowed to be \(\infty\)) , then%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{assemblage}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3839}{}%
(To be technically correct, we need to add the additional hypothesis that \(g'(x) \ne 0\) on an open interval that contains \(a\) or in every neighborhood of infinity if \(a\) is \(\infty\); this is almost always met in practice.)%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3840}{}%
To evaluate \(\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2}{e^x}\), we can apply L'Hopital's Rule, since both \(x^2 \to \infty\) and \(e^x \to \infty\). Doing so, it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2}{e^x} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{2x}{e^x}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3841}{}%
This updated limit is still indeterminate and of the form \(\frac{\infty}{\infty}\), but it is simpler since \(2x\) has replaced \(x^2\). Hence, we can apply L'Hopital's Rule again, and find that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2}{e^x} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{2x}{e^x} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{2}{e^x}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3842}{}%
Now, since \(2\) is constant and \(e^x \to \infty\) as \(x \to \infty\), it follows that \(\frac{2}{e^x} \to 0\) as \(x \to \infty\), which shows that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2}{e^x} = 0\text{.}

As both numerator and denominator tend to \(\infty\) as \(x \to \infty\), by L'Hopital's Rule followed by some elementary algebra,%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x}{\ln(x)} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{\frac{1}{x}} = \lim_{x \to \infty} x = \infty\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-2509}{}\hypertarget{p-3860}{}%
Because this limit has indeterminate form \(\frac{\infty}{\infty}\), L'Hopital's Rule tells us that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{e^{x} + x}{2e^{x} + x^2} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{e^{x} + 1}{2e^{x} + 2x}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
The latest limit is indeterminate for the same reason, and a second application of the rule shows%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{e^{x} + x}{2e^{x} + x^2} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{e^{x}}{2e^{x} + 2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Note how each application of the rule produces a simpler numerator and denominator. With one more use of L'Hopital's Rule, followed by a simple algebraic simplification, we have%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{e^{x} + x}{2e^{x} + x^2} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{e^{x}}{2e^{x}} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-2510}{}\hypertarget{p-3861}{}%
As \(x \to 0^+\), \(\ln(x) \to -\infty\) and \(\frac{1}{x} \to +\infty\), thus by L'Hopital's Rule,%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{\ln(x)}{\frac{1}{x}} = \lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{\frac{1}{x}}{-\frac{1}{x^2}}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Reciprocating, multiplying, and simplifying, it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{\ln(x)}{\frac{1}{x}} = \lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{1}{x}\cdot \frac{x^2}{-1} = \lim_{x \to 0^+} -x = 0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-2511}{}\hypertarget{p-3862}{}%
Here, the numerator tends to \(\infty\) while the denominator tends to \(0^-\). Note well that this limit is not indeterminate, but rather produces a collection of fractions with large positive numerators and small negative denominators. Hence%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to \frac{\pi}{2}^-} \frac{\tan(x)}{x-\frac{\pi}{2}} = -\infty\text{.}
\end{equation*}
In particular, we observe that L'Hopital's Rule is not applicable here.%
\end{enumerate}

\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-3863}{}%
To evaluate the limit of a quotient of two functions \(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\) that results in an indeterminate form of \(\frac{\infty}{\infty}\), in essence we are asking which function is growing faster without bound. We say that the function \(g\) \terminology{dominates} \index{function!dominance} the function \(f\) as \(x \to \infty\) provided that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0\text{,}
\end{equation*}
whereas \(f\) dominates \(g\) provided that \(\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \infty\). Finally, if the value of \(\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\) is finite and nonzero, we say that \(f\) and \(g\) \emph{grow at the same rate}. For example, we saw that \(\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2}{e^x} = 0\), so \(e^x\) dominates \(x^2\), while \(\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} \frac{3x^2 - 4x + 5}{7x^2 + 9x - 10} = \frac{3}{7}\), so \(f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 5\) and \(g(x) = 7x^2 + 9x - 10\) grow at the same rate.%

\hypertarget{p-3864}{}%
While the main two indeterminate forms are \(\frac{0}{0}\) and \(\frac{\infty}{\infty}\), there are other indeterminate forms which can be rewritten in order to use L'Hopital's Rule.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3865}{}%
The following example is a classic use of L'Hopital's Rule.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-169}
\hypertarget{p-3866}{}%
Evaluate the following limit. If you use L'Hopital's Rule, indicate where it was used, and be certain its hypotheses are met before you apply it.%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x\to \infty}(1+\frac{1}{x})^x
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3867}{}%
Notice that \(1+\frac{1}{x}\to 1\) as \(x\to\infty\). So this limit takes the form \(1^{\infty}\), which is an indeterminate form.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3868}{}%
We need a couple extra steps before we can apply L'Hopital's Rule. First, let's set \(y=(1+\frac{1}{x})^x\). Note that \(\ln(y)=\ln(1+\frac{1}{x})^x=x\ln(1+\frac{1}{x}).\) Then%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x\to\infty}(1+\frac{1}{x})^x=\lim_{x\to\infty}y=\lim_{x\to\infty}e^{\ln(y)}=e^{\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}\ln(y)}.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3869}{}%
Therefore, we need to evaluate \(\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}\ln(y)=\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}x\ln(1+\frac{1}{x}).\)%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3870}{}%
As \(x\to\infty\) this limit approaches \(\infty\cdot 0\), which is another indeterminate form. We still have not met the conditions to apply L'Hopital's rule, but are getting closer. We can rewrite the limit in the following way%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x\to\infty}x\ln(1+\frac{1}{x})=\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{\ln(1+\frac{1}{x})}{1/x}.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3871}{}%
This limit has the indeterminate form \(\frac{0}{0}\), so we can apply L'Hopital's Rule at this point:%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{\ln(1+\frac{1}{x})}{\frac{1}{x}}=\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{x}}\cdot\frac{-1}{x^2}}{-\frac{1}{x^2}}=\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{x}}=1.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3872}{}%
So finally, we have%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x\to\infty}(1+\frac{1}{x})^x=e^{1}=e.
\end{equation*}
%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-3873}{}%
Other types of forms include \(0\cdot\infty\), \(\infty-\infty\), \(1^{\infty}\), \(0^0\), and \(\infty^0\). The following examples demonstrate a few of these other forms.%

In its original form, \(\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} xe^{-x}\), is indeterminate of form \(\infty \cdot 0\). Rewriting \(e^{-x}\) as \(\frac{1}{e^x}\), a straightforward application of L'Hopital's Rule tells us that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to \infty} xe^{-x} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x}{e^x} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{e^x}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Since \(e^x \to \infty\) as \(x \to \infty\), we find that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to \infty} xe^{-x} = 0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-2522}{}\hypertarget{p-3888}{}%
In its original form, \(\lim\limits_{x\to \frac{\pi}{2}^{-}}\left(\sec(x)-\tan(x)\right)\) has the indeterminate form \(\infty-\infty\). Rewriting \(\sec(x)\) as \(\frac{1}{\cos(x)}\) and \(\tan(x)\) as \(\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}\) we have%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x\to \frac{\pi}{2}^{-}}\left(\sec(x)-\tan(x)\right)=\lim_{x\to \frac{\pi}{2}^{-}}\frac{1}{\cos(x)}-\frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}=\lim_{x\to \frac{\pi}{2}^{-}}\frac{1-\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}.
\end{equation*}
Since both numerator and demoninator approach 0, we can apply L'Hopital's Rule,%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x\to \frac{\pi}{2}^{-}}\sec(x)-\tan(x)=\lim_{x\to \frac{\pi}{2}^{-}}\frac{1-\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}=\lim_{x\to \frac{\pi}{2}^{-}}\frac{-\cos(x)}{-\sin(x)}=0.

\item\hypertarget{li-2523}{}\hypertarget{p-3889}{}%
In its original form, \(\lim\limits_{x \to 0^+} x^{x}\) has the indeterminate form \(0^0\). We can rewrite \(x^x\) using logarithmic and exponential functions as \(e^{x\ln(x)}\). Thus,%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x\to 0^+}x^x=\lim_{x\to 0^+}e^{x\ln(x)}=e^{\lim\limits_{x\to 0^+}x\ln(x)}.
\end{equation*}
We evaluate \(\lim\limits_{x\to 0^+}x\ln(x)\) to get the indeterminate form \(0\cdot \infty\). Rewriting again, we have%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x\to 0^+}x\ln(x)=\lim_{x\to 0^+}\frac{\ln(x)}{\frac{1}{x}}.
\end{equation*}
Since both numerator and denominator approach \(\infty\), we can apply L'Hopital's Rule,%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x\to 0^+}\frac{\ln(x)}{\frac{1}{x}}=\lim_{x\to 0^+}\frac{\frac{1}{x}}{-\frac{1}{x^2}}=\lim_{x\to 0^+}\frac{-x^2}{x}=\lim_{x\to 0^+}-x=0.
\end{equation*}
Finally, we have%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to 0^+} x^{x}=e^0=1.

Derivatives can be used to help us evaluate indeterminate limits of the form \(\frac{0}{0}\) through L'Hopital's Rule, by replacing the functions in the numerator and denominator with their tangent line approximations. In particular, if \(f(a) = g(a) = 0\) and \(f\) and \(g\) are differentiable at \(a\), L'Hopital's Rule tells us that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to a}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3892}{}%
When we write \(x \to \infty\), this means that \(x\) is increasing without bound. Thus, \(\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} f(x) = L\) means that we can make \(f(x)\) as close to \(L\) as we like by choosing \(x\) to be sufficiently large. Similarly, \(\lim\limits_{x \to a} f(x) = \infty\), means that we can make \(f(x)\) as large as we like by choosing \(x\) sufficiently close to \(a\).%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3893}{}%
A version of L'Hopital's Rule also helps us evaluate indeterminate limits of the form \(\frac{\infty}{\infty}\). If \(f\) and \(g\) are differentiable and both approach zero or both approach \(\pm \infty\) as \(x \to a\) (where \(a\) is allowed to be \(\infty\)), then%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}\text{.}

See the figure below for possible graphs of \(f\) and \(g\). To evaluate the limit, we can apply L'Hopital's Rule twice. Since \(f(3) = g(3) = 0\), we know by the rule that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to 3} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to 3}  \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Since \(f'(3) = g'(3) = 0\), the limit is still indeterminate, and we can apply the rule again to get%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to 3} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to 3}  \frac{f''(x)}{g''(x)} = \frac{f''(3)}{g''(3)} = \frac{-2}{1}\text{.}

Hence, \(\lim\limits_{x \to 3} h(x) = -2\).%

\hypertarget{p-3900}{}%
First, we note that since both the numerator and denominator of \(R\) are quadratic, the limit as \(x \to \infty\) can be found by taking the quotient of the leading coefficients. In particular,%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to \infty} R(x) = \frac{3}{5}
\end{equation*}
and thus the horizontal asymptote of \(R\) is \(y = \frac{3}{5}\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3901}{}%
Next, since \(b\) and \(c\) are distinct, we see that the numerator of \(R\) is zero (and the denominator is not) when \(x = b\), and thus \(R(b) = 0\). In addition, the denominator is zero (and the numerator is not) when \(x = c\), and this results in there being a vertical asymptote at \(x = c\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3902}{}%
Finally, we observe that \(x = a\) makes both the numerator and denominator zero. Since \(R(a)\) is thus not defined, the graph of \(R\) has either a hole or a vertical asymptote at \(x = a\). To determine which, we evaluate the limit and see that%
\begin{equation*}

This tells us that \(R\) has a hole at the point \((a, \frac{3(a-b)}{5(a-c)})\). Moreover, \(R\) is not continuous at \(x = a\) and \(x = c\).%

Since \(h(x) = \ln(g(x))\) and we are given that \(g(x) = x^{2x}\), it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
h(x) = \ln(x^{2x}) = 2x \cdot \ln(x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-2536}{}\hypertarget{p-3916}{}%
Since \(x = (x^{-1})^{-1} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{x}}\), we can also write%

Since \(\ln(x) \to -\infty\) as \(x \to 0^+\) and \(\frac{1}{x} \to +\infty\) as \(x \to 0^+\), we see that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to 0^+} h(x) = \lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{2\ln(x)}{\frac{1}{x}}
\end{equation*}
is of an indeterminate form to which we can apply L'Hopital's Rule. Doing so,%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to 0^+} h(x) = \lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{2\ln(x)}{\frac{1}{x}} = \lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{\frac{2}{x}}{-\frac{1}{x^2}}

Simplifying algebraically,%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to 0^+} h(x) = \lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{2}{x} \cdot \left(-\frac{x^2}{1}\right) = \lim_{x \to 0^+} (-2x)

\item\hypertarget{li-2549}{}\hypertarget{p-3932}{}%
We note that both  \(\ln(x)\) or \(\sqrt{x}\) increase without bound as \(x \to \infty\), so we consider%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{\ln(x)}{\sqrt{x}}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
By L'Hopital's Rule and some simplifying algebra,%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{\ln(x)}{\sqrt{x}} = \lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{\frac{1}{x}}{\frac{1}{2x^{1/2}}} = \lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{2x^{1/2}}{x} = \lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{2}{x^{1/2}}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Thus, it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{\ln(x)}{\sqrt{x}} = 0\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and hence \(\sqrt{x}\) dominates \(\ln(x)\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2550}{}\hypertarget{p-3933}{}%
Using a similar argument to our work in \((a)\), we can show that \(\sqrt[n]{x}\) dominates \(\ln(x)\) for any positive integer \(n\). In particular, by L'Hopital's Rule and some simplifying algebra,%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{\ln(x)}{\sqrt[n]{x}} = \lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{\frac{1}{x}}{\frac{1}{nx^{(n-1)/n}}} = \lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{nx^{(n-1)/n}}{x}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Since \(\frac{x^{(n-1)/n}}{x} = x^{(n-1)/n - 1} = x^{(n-1-n)/n} = x^{-1/n}\), it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{\ln(x)}{\sqrt[n]{x}} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{x^{1/n}} = 0
\end{equation*}
we've shown that \(\sqrt[n]{x}\) dominates \(\ln(x)\) for any positive integer \(n\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2551}{}\hypertarget{p-3934}{}%
To see why \(e^x\) will dominate any polynomial function, consider \(p(x) = x^4\). If we consider the limit of their quotient and apply LHR once, we see that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^4}{e^x} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{4x^3}{e^x}
\end{equation*}
By repeated application of LHR, the numerator (regardless of what polynomial we start with) will eventually be simply a constant (after \(n\) applications of LHR), and thus with \(e^x\) still in the denominator, the overall limit will be \(0\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2552}{}\hypertarget{p-3935}{}%
Here we naturally consider the limit of the quotient of \(\ln(x)\) and \(x^n\), where \(n \ge 1\). Since both functions increase without bound, we can apply LHR.  Doing so along with some simplifying algebra, we see%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\ln(x)}{x^n} =  \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{\frac{1}{x}}{nx^{n-1}} = \frac{1}{nx^n} = 0

and thus \(x^n\) indeed dominates.%

Consider \(f(x) = 3x^2 + 1\) and \(g(x) = -0.5x^2 + 5x - 2\). Since these functions are polynomials of the same degree, we know%

Up to this point, we have been representing a graph by a single equation involving two variables such as \(x\) and \(y\). However, some items are not really well described by such equations. In this section, you will study situations in which it is useful to introduce a \emph{third variable} to represent a curve in the plane.  This process is commonly called parameterization and is the basis for our study of parametric curves.%

Consider the path of an object that is propelled into the air at an angle of \(45^{\circ}\).  In a physics class, you might learn that this object would follow a parabolic path.  That is,%
\begin{equation*}
y=-\frac{x^2}{72}+x
\end{equation*}
However, this equation does not tell the whole story. While the equation does tell you where the object has been, it does not tell you \emph{when} the object was at a given point \((x, y)\) on the path. To determine this time, you can introduce a third variable \(t\), called a parameter. It is possible to write both \(x\) and \(y\) as functions of \(t\) to obtain the parametric equations%
\begin{align*}
x(t) \amp= 24 \sqrt{2}t\\
y(t) \amp =-16t^2+24\sqrt{2}t
\end{align*}
The parametric equations are graphed in \hyperref[basicparametricgraph]{Figure~\ref{basicparametricgraph}} below.  Using the parametric equations, we can state properties such as: at time \(t = 0\), the object is at the point \((0, 0)\) and at time \(t = 1\), the object is at the point \((24 \sqrt{2},24\sqrt{2}-16)\).%

One of the most effective ways to sketch a parametric curve is to create a table of values by choosing various values of \(t\) and computing both \(x(t)\) and \(y(t)\).  The following example demonstrates this procedure.%

\hypertarget{p-3952}{}%
A reasonable first step is to cerate a table of values for \(t=-2,-1,0,1,2,3\).  Why these values of \(t\)?  Choosing "good" values of \(t\) is not always a straight forward task and in general you must choose values that give you a "reasonable" picture of the curve.  You also might wonder how many values of \(t\) are appropriate.  Again, the answer is enough values that you can be reasonably confident you have captured the shape of the curve.  So what does this mean?  Often it helps to choose a few positive and negative values close to zero, calculate these values, plot the points, and then determine if you need more values to give your curve a clear shape.%

 We plot these values on a coordinate plane and then connect the values with appropriate curves as in \hyperref[graphingparametric]{Figure~\ref{graphingparametric}}.  It is often helpful to place arrows on the curve to indicate how the curve changes as \(t\) increases.%

You may notice in \hyperref[graphingparametric]{Figure~\ref{graphingparametric}} that the curve seems to start abruptly at \(t=-2\).

Since \((\cos(t))^2 + (\sin(t))^2 = 1\), we have \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\). That is, at any time \(t\) the particle is at a point \((x, y)\) on the unit circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\). We plot points at different times to see how the particle moves on the circle. The particle completes one full trip counterclockwise around the circle every \(2\pi\) units of time. Notice how the \(x\)-coordinate goes back and forth from \(-1\) to \(1\) while the \(y\)-coordinate goes up and down from \(-1\) to \(1\). The two motions combine to trace out a circle. \begin{table}

\hypertarget{p-3961}{}%
Suppose an object moves with constant speed along a straight line through the point \((x_0, y_0)\).  Recall that they key to motion in a straight line is that the rate of change is constant.  In other words, both the \(x\) and \(y\)-coordinates have a constant rate of change. For convenience, let \(a = \frac{dx}{dt}\) and \(b = \frac{dy}{dt}\) be the rate of change in the \(x\) and \(y\) directions, respectively. Then at time \(t\) the object has coordinates \(x = x_0 + at\), \(y = y_0 + bt\). Notice that \(a\) represents the change in \(x\) in one unit of time, and \(b\) represents the change in \(y\) in one unit of time (see \hyperref[graphingparametric1-44]{Figure~\ref{graphingparametric1-44}}). Thus the line has slope \(m = \frac{b}{a}\).  Therefore, the parametric equations for motion in a straight line are given by \(x = x_0 + at\), \(y = y_0 + bt\). \begin{figure}

Now that we have developed the notion of motion in a straight line for parametric equations we can discuss tangent lines for parametric equations. \begin{assemblage}[Parametric Equations for the Tangent Line]\label{assemblage-92}

\index{parametric equation!tangent line} \index{tangent line!parametric equation} An object moving along a line through the point \((x_0, y_0)\), with \(\frac{dx}{dt} = a\) and \(\frac{dy}{dt} = b\), has parametric equations%

At time \(t = 1\) the particle is at the point \((1, 2)\). The velocity in the \(x\)-direction at time \(t\) is \(v_x = \frac{dx}{dt} = 3t^2\), and the velocity in the \(y\)-direction is \(v_y = \frac{dy}{dt} = 2\). So at \(t = 1\) the velocity in the \(x\)-direction is 3 and the velocity in the \(y\)-direction is \(2\). Thus the tangent line has parametric equations%
\begin{equation*}
x = 1 + 3t\mbox{, } y = 2 + 2t.
\end{equation*}
%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-3968}{}%
With the notion of a tangent line in hand we are in the position to be able to talk about the speed and velocity of an object whose position is given by parametric equations.  In general, given an object traveling in the \(xy\)-plane we can break its movement into two pieces.  Movement in the "\(x\)-direction" and movement in the "\(y\)-direction."  We can also talk about rate-of-change in the "\(x\)-direction" (\(\frac{dx}{dt}\)) and rate-of-change in the "\(y\)-direction" (\(\frac{dy}{dt}\)).  If we think of these rates of change as vectors then we can use the Pythagorean theorem to talk about the instantaneous speed \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) , see \hyperref[graphingparametric1-45]{Figure~\ref{graphingparametric1-45}}. \begin{figure}

Differentiating gives \(\frac{dx}{dt} = 2 + e^t\), \(\frac{dy}{dt} = 3\). When \(t = 1\) we have \(v_x = 2 + e\), \(v_y = 3\). So the velocity vector is%

\begin{objectives}{Motivating Questions}\label{objectives-26}
%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3981}{}%
If we know the velocity of a moving body at every point in a given interval, can we determine the distance the object has traveled on that time interval?%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3982}{}%
How is the problem of finding distance traveled related to finding the area under a certain curve?%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3983}{}%
What does it mean to antidifferentiate a function and why is this process relevant to finding distance traveled?%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-3984}{}%
If velocity is negative, how does this impact the problem of finding distance traveled?%
\end{itemize}
\end{objectives}
\hypertarget{p-3985}{}%
In the first chapter of the text, we considered a moving object with known position at time \(t\), namely, a tennis ball tossed into the air with height \(s\) (in feet) at time \(t\) (in seconds) given by \(s(t) = 64 - 16(t-1)^2\). We investigated the average velocity of the ball on an interval \([a,b]\), computed by the difference quotient \(\frac{s(b)-s(a)}{b-a}\). We found that we could determine the instantaneous velocity of the ball at time \(t\) by taking the derivative of the position function,%
\begin{equation*}
s'(t) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{s(t+h)-s(t)}{h}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3986}{}%
Thus, if its position function is differentiable, we can find the velocity of a moving object at any point in time.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3987}{}%
From this study of position and velocity we have learned a great deal. We can use the derivative to find a function's instantaneous rate of change at any point in the domain, to find where the function is increasing or decreasing, where it is concave up or concave down, and to locate relative extremes. The vast majority of the problems and applications we have considered have involved the situation where a particular function is known and we seek information that relies on knowing the function's instantaneous rate of change. For all these tasks, we proceed from a function \(f\) to its derivative, \(f'\), and use the meaning of the derivative to help us answer important questions.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3988}{}%
We have also encountered the reverse situation, where we know the derivative of a function, \(f'\), and try to deduce information about \(f\). We will focus our attention in \hyperref[C-4]{Chapter~\ref{C-4}} on this problem: if we know the instantaneous rate of change of a function, can we find the function itself? We start with a more specific question: if we know the instantaneous velocity of an object moving along a straight line path, can we find its corresponding position function?%

In \hyperref[PA-4-1]{Example~\ref{PA-4-1}}, we learned that when the velocity of a moving object's velocity is constant (and positive), the area under the velocity curve over an interval of time tells us the distance the object traveled.%
\begin{figure}

\caption{At left, a constant velocity function; at right, a non-constant velocity function.\label{F-4-1-VelArea}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-4015}{}%
The left-hand graph of \hyperref[F-4-1-VelArea]{Figure~\ref{F-4-1-VelArea}} shows the velocity of an object moving at 2 miles per hour over the time interval \([1,1.5]\). The area \(A_1\) of the shaded region under \(y = v(t)\) on \([1,1.5]\) is%
\begin{equation*}
A_1= 2 \, \frac{\text{miles} }{\text{hour} } \cdot \frac{1}{2} \, \text{hours}  = 1 \, \text{mile}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4016}{}%
This result is simply the fact that distance equals rate times time, provided the rate is constant. Thus, if \(v(t)\) is constant on the interval \([a,b]\), the distance traveled on \([a,b]\) is equal to the area \(A\) given by%
\begin{equation*}
A = v(a) (b-a) = v(a) \Delta t\text{,}
\end{equation*}
where \(\Delta t\) is the change in \(t\) over the interval. (Since the velocity is constant, we can use any value of \(v(t)\) on the interval \([a,b]\), we simply chose \(v(a)\), the value at the interval's left endpoint.) For several examples where the velocity function is piecewise constant, see \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/9T}{http://gvsu.edu/s/9T}.\footnote{Marc Renault, calculus applets.\label{fn-42}}%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4017}{}%
The situation is more complicated when the velocity function is not constant. But on relatively small intervals where \(v(t)\) does not vary much, we can use the area principle to estimate the distance traveled. The right-hand graph of \hyperref[F-4-1-VelArea]{Figure~\ref{F-4-1-VelArea}} shows a non-constant velocity function. On the interval \([1,1.5]\), the velocity varies from \(v(1) = 2.5\) down to \(v(1.5) \approx 2.1\). One estimate for the distance traveled is the area of the pictured rectangle,%
\begin{equation*}
A_2 = v(1) \Delta t = 2.5 \, \frac{\text{miles} }{\text{hour} } \cdot \frac{1}{2} \, \text{hours}  = 1.25 \, \text{miles}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4018}{}%
Note that because \(v\) is decreasing on \([1,1.5]\), \(A_2 = 1.25\) is an over-estimate of the actual distance traveled.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4019}{}%
To estimate the area under this non-constant velocity function on a wider interval, say \([0,3]\), one rectangle will not give a good approximation. Instead, we could use the six rectangles pictured in \hyperref[F-4-1-VelArea2]{Figure~\ref{F-4-1-VelArea2}}, find the area of each rectangle, and add up the total. Obviously there are choices to make and issues to understand: How many rectangles should we use? Where should we evaluate the function to decide the rectangle's height? What happens if the velocity is sometimes negative? Can we find the exact area under any non-constant curve?%

\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-4020}{}%
We will study these questions and more in what follows; for now it suffices to observe that the simple idea of the area of a rectangle gives us a powerful tool for estimating distance traveled from a velocity function, as well as for estimating the area under an arbitrary curve. To explore the use of multiple rectangles to approximate area under a non-constant velocity function, see the applet found at \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/9U}{http://gvsu.edu/s/9U}.\footnote{Marc Renault, calculus applets.\label{fn-43}}%

It appears that a better approximation could be found using narrower rectangles. If we move to 8 rectangles of width \(0.25\), similar computations show that \(D \approx 3.875\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2601}{}\hypertarget{p-4040}{}%
By thinking about how the power rule for differentiation works, we can undo this rule and find a position function \(s\) whose derivative is \(v\). For instance, since \(\frac{d}{dt}[t^4] = 4t^3\), we see that \(\frac{d}{dt}[\frac{1}{8}t^4] = \frac{1}{2}t^3\). Thus, if we let%
\begin{equation*}
s(t) = \frac{1}{8}t^4 - \frac{1}{2} t^3 + \frac{3}{4} t^2 + \frac{3}{2}t\text{,}
\end{equation*}
then it is straightforward to check that \(s'(t) = \frac{1}{2}t^3 - \frac{3}{2}t^2 + \frac{3}{2}t + \frac{3}{2}\), which is precisely the formula for \(v(t)\) that we were given.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2602}{}\hypertarget{p-4041}{}%
By the rule found in (c) for \(s\), we have that \(s(2) - s(0) = \frac{1}{8}2^4 - \frac{1}{2}2^3 + \frac{3}{4}2^2 + \frac{3}{2} 2 = 2 - 4 + 3 + 3 = 4\). This is the change in the walker's position over the time interval \([0,2]\), and since the velocity is always positive, this is actually the exact distance traveled. We see how both earlier estimates (\(3.75\) and \(3.785\)) are good approximations to this value.%

\index{antidifferentiation}\index{distance traveled}\hypertarget{p-4042}{}%
When the velocity of a moving object is positive, the object's position is always increasing. (We will soon consider situations where velocity is negative; for now, we focus on the situation where velocity is always positive.) We have established that whenever \(v\) is constant on an interval, the exact distance traveled is the area under the velocity curve. When \(v\) is not constant, we can estimate the total distance traveled by finding the areas of rectangles that approximate the area under the velocity curve.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4043}{}%
Thus, we see that finding the area between a curve and the horizontal axis is an important exercise: besides being an interesting geometric question, if the curve gives the velocity of a moving object, the area under the curve tells us the exact distance traveled on an interval. We can estimate this area if we have a graph or a table of values for the velocity function.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4044}{}%
In \hyperref[act-4-1-1]{Example~\ref{act-4-1-1}}, we encountered an alternate approach to finding the distance traveled. If \(y = v(t)\) is a formula for the instantaneous velocity of a moving object, then \(v\) must be the derivative of the object's position function, \(s\). If we can find a formula for \(s(t)\) from the formula for \(v(t)\), we will know the position of the object at time \(t\), and the change in position over a particular time interval tells us the distance traveled on that interval.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4045}{}%
For a simple example, consider the situation from \hyperref[PA-4-1]{Example~\ref{PA-4-1}}, where a person is walking along a straight line with velocity function \(v(t) = 3\) mph.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/4_1_PA1Soln.pdf}
\caption{The velocity function \(v(t) = 3\) and corresponding position function \(s(t) = 3t\).\label{F-4-1-PA1Soln}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-4046}{}%
On the left-hand graph of the velocity function in \hyperref[F-4-1-PA1Soln]{Figure~\ref{F-4-1-PA1Soln}}, we see the relationship between area and distance traveled,%
\begin{equation*}
A= 3 \, \frac{\text{miles} }{\text{hour} } \cdot 1.25 \, \text{hours}  = 3.75 \, \text{miles}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
In addition, we observe\footnote{Here we are making the implicit assumption that \(s(0) = 0\); we will discuss different possibilities for values of \(s(0)\) in subsequent study.\label{fn-44}} that if \(s(t) = 3t\), then \(s'(t) = 3\), so \(s(t) = 3t\) is the position function whose derivative is the given velocity function, \(v(t) = 3\). The respective locations of the person at times \(t = 0.25\) and \(t = 1.5\) are \(s(1.5) = 4.5\) and \(s(0.25) = 0.75\), and therefore%
\begin{equation*}
s(1.5) - s(0.25) = 4.5 - 0.75 = 3.75 \ \text{miles}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4047}{}%
This is the person's change in position on \([0.25,1.5]\), which is precisely the distance traveled. In this example there are profound ideas and connections that we will study throughout \hyperref[C-4]{Chapter~\ref{C-4}}.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4048}{}%
For now, observe that if we know a formula for a velocity function \(v\), it can be very helpful to find a function \(s\) that satisfies \(s' = v\). We say that \(s\) is an \emph{antiderivative} of \(v\). More generally, we have the following formal definition.%
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{definition-1}
\hypertarget{p-4049}{}%
If \(g\) and \(G\) are functions such that \(G' = g\), we say that \(G\) is an \terminology{antiderivative} \index{antiderivative} of \(g\).%
\end{definition}
\hypertarget{p-4050}{}%
For example, if \(g(x) = 3x^2 + 2x\), \(G(x) = x^3 + x^2\) is an antiderivative of \(g\), because \(G'(x) = g(x)\). Note that we say ``an'' antiderivative of \(g\) rather than ``the'' antiderivative of \(g\), because \(H(x) = x^3 + x^2 + 5\) is also a function whose derivative is \(g\), and thus \(H\) is another antiderivative of \(g\).%

Note that \(v(1) = 0\) and for \(0 \lt t \lt 1\), \(v(t) \gt 0\). This means that on the interval \((0,1)\), the position function \(s\) is increasing because velocity is positive.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2622}{}\hypertarget{p-4075}{}%
We can check that the derivative of \(s(t) = 32t - 16t^2\) is \(s'(t) = v(t) = 32 - 32t\), and that \(s(0) = 0\), so this is the antiderivative of \(v\) that we desire.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2623}{}\hypertarget{p-4076}{}%
Now, \(s(1) - s(\frac{1}{2}) = (32 - 16) - (16 - 4) = 4\), which is the change in position of the ball on the interval \([\frac{1}{2},1]\). Equivalently, since \(v\) is positive through this interval, 4 feet is the vertical distance the ball traveled during this time.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2624}{}\hypertarget{p-4077}{}%
On the interval from \(t = \frac{1}{2}\) to \(t = 1\), the corresponding area under the velocity curve is the area of the right triangular region whose width is \(\frac{1}{2}\) seconds and whose height is \(v(\frac{1}{2}) = 16\) feet/sec. That area is therefore \(A = \frac{1}{2} bh = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot 16 = 4\) feet. This is the total distance the ball traveled vertically on \([0,\frac{1}{2}]\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2625}{}\hypertarget{p-4078}{}%
\(s(1) - s(0) = (32 - 16) - (0-0) = 16\), which is the vertical distance the ball traveled on the interval \([0,1]\). The area under the velocity curve on \([0,1]\) is the area of the triangle with height 32 (ft/sec) and base 1 (second), which is \(A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot 32 = 16\) feet. These two results are identical, in part due to the fact that we are using two different perspectives to compute the same quantity, which is distance traveled.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2626}{}\hypertarget{p-4079}{}%
Observe that \(s(2) - s(0) = (32 - 32) - (0 - 0) = 0\). This means that the ball has zero change in position on the interval \([0,2]\). But we already established that on the interval \([0,1]\), the ball traveled 16 feet vertically; since the velocity becomes negative on the interval \(1 \lt t \lt 2\), there we know the ball's position is decreasing, so it is falling back to earth. The resulting zero change in position means that at \(t = 2\) the ball has returned to the location from which it was tossed. If we view the area between the velocity function and the \(t\)-axis as being negative wherever \(v\) is negative, then we see that the areas of the two triangles involved are opposites, which in some sense results in the ``total area'' being zero, matching the change in position.%

\subsection[{When velocity is negative}]{When velocity is negative}\label{subsection-104}
\hypertarget{p-4080}{}%
The assumption that velocity is positive on a given interval guarantees that the movement of an object is always in a single direction, and hence ensures that its change in position is the same as the distance it travels. As we saw in \hyperref[act-4-1-2]{Example~\ref{act-4-1-2}}, there are natural settings in which an object's velocity is negative, and we would like to understand this scenario as well.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4081}{}%
Consider a simple example where a woman goes for a walk on the beach along a stretch of very straight shoreline that runs east-west. We assume that her initial position is \(s(0) = 0\), and that her position function increases as she moves east from her starting location. For instance, \(s = 1\) mile represents one mile east of the start location, while \(s = -1\) tells us she is one mile west of where she began walking on the beach.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4082}{}%
Now suppose she walks in the following manner. From the outset at \(t = 0\), she walks due east at a constant rate of \(3\) mph for 1.5 hours. After 1.5 hours, she stops abruptly and begins walking due west at a constant rate of \(4\) mph and does so for 0.5 hours. Then, after another abrupt stop and start, she resumes walking at a constant rate of \(3\) mph to the east for one more hour. What is the total distance she traveled on the time interval from \(t = 0\) to \(t = 3\)? What the total change in her position over that time?%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4083}{}%
These questions are possible to answer without calculus because the velocity is constant on each interval. From \(t = 0\) to \(t = 1.5\), she traveled%
\begin{equation*}
D_{[0,1.5]} = 3 \ \text{miles per hour}  \cdot 1.5 \ \text{hours}  = 4.5 \ \text{miles}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4084}{}%
On \(t = 1.5\) to \(t = 2\), the distance traveled is%
\begin{equation*}
D_{[1.5,2]} = 4 \ \text{miles per hour}  \cdot 0.5 \ \text{hours}  = 2 \ \text{miles}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4085}{}%
Finally, in the last hour she walked%
\begin{equation*}
D_{[2,3]} = 3 \ \text{miles per hour}  \cdot 1 \ \text{hours}  = 3 \ \text{miles}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
so the total distance she traveled is%
\begin{equation*}
D = D_{[0,1.5]} + D_{[1.5,2]} + D_{[2,3]} = 4.5 + 2 + 3 = 9.5 \ \text{miles}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4086}{}%
Since the velocity for \(1.5 \lt  t \lt  2\) is \(v = -4\), indicating motion in the westward direction, the woman first walked 4.5 miles east, then 2 miles west, followed by 3 more miles east. Thus, the total change in her position is%
\begin{equation*}
\text{change in position}  = 4.5 - 2 + 3 = 5.5 \ \text{miles}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par

We have been able to answer these questions fairly easily, and if we think about the problem graphically, we can generalize our solution to the more complicated setting when velocity is not constant, and possibly negative.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/4_1_NegVel.pdf}
\caption{At left, the velocity function of the person walking; at right, the corresponding position function.\label{F-4-1-NegVel}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-4088}{}%
In \hyperref[F-4-1-NegVel]{Figure~\ref{F-4-1-NegVel}}, we see how the distances we computed can be viewed as areas: \(A_1 = 4.5\) comes from multiplyimg rate times time (\(3 \cdot 1.5\)), as do \(A_2\) and \(A_3\). But while \(A_2\) is an area (and is therefore positive), because the velocity function is negative for \(1.5 \lt t \lt 2\), this area has a negative sign associated with it. The negative area distinguishes between distance traveled and change in position.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4089}{}%
The distance traveled is the sum of the areas,%
\begin{equation*}
D = A_1 + A_2 + A_3 = 4.5 + 2 + 3 = 9.5 \ \text{miles}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4090}{}%
But the change in position has to account for travel in the negative direction. An area above the \(t\)-axis is considered positive because it represents distance traveled in the positive direction, while one below the \(t\)-axis is viewed as negative because it represents travel in the negative direction. Thus, the change in the woman's position is%
\begin{equation*}
s(3) - s(0) = (+4.5) + (-2) + (+3) = 5.5 \ \text{miles}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
In other words, the woman walks 4.5 miles in the positive direction, followed by two miles in the negative direction, and then 3 more miles in the positive direction.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4091}{}%
Negative velocity is also seen in the graph of the position function \(y=s(t)\). Its slope is negative (specifically, \(-4\)) on the interval \(1.5\lt t\lt 2\) because the velocity is \(-4\) on that interval. The negative slope shows the position function is decreasing because the woman is walking east, rather than west.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4092}{}%
To summarize, we see that if velocity is sometimes negative, a moving object's change in position different from its distance traveled. If we compute separately the distance traveled on each interval where velocity is positive or negative, we can calculate either the total distance traveled or the total change in position. We assign a negative value to distances traveled in the negative direction when we calculate change in position, but a positive value when we calculate the total distance traveled.%
\begin{example}[]\label{act-4-1-3}
\hypertarget{p-4093}{}%
Suppose that an object moving along a straight line path has its velocity \(v\) (in meters per second) at time \(t\) (in seconds) given by the piecewise linear function whose graph is pictured at left in \hyperref[F-4-1-Act3]{Figure~\ref{F-4-1-Act3}}. We view movement to the right as being in the positive direction (with positive velocity), while movement to the left is in the negative direction.%

By finding the area of the triangular regions formed between \(y = v(t)\) and the \(t\)-axis on \([0,1]\) and \([1,2]\) (each of which is \(1\)), it follows that the object's total distance traveled is \(2\), while its change in position is \(0\). The latter is true since the net signed area bounded by \(v\) on \([0,2]\) is \(1 - 1 = 0\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2640}{}\hypertarget{p-4111}{}%
The object's position is increasing wherever its velocity is positive, hence for \(0 \le t \lt 1\) and \(4 \lt t \lt 8 \).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2641}{}\hypertarget{p-4112}{}%
By calculating the area bounded by the curve, we find 1 unit of area on \([0,1]\), 4 units of area on \([1,4]\), and 8 units of area on \([4,8]\), thus the total distance traveled on \(0 \le t \le 8\) is \(D = 1 + 4 + 8\) meters. As the change in position is given by the net signed area on this interval, we find that the change in position is%
\begin{equation*}
s(8) - s(0) = 1 - 4 + 8 = 5 \ \mbox{m}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-2642}{}\hypertarget{p-4113}{}%
In the figure below, at left we list all of the areas bounded by \(v\) on each one-unit subinterval. Along with the given starting point that \(s(0) = 1\), we use the resulting changes in position to plot points for the function \(s\). For instance, we know \(s(1) - s(0) = 1\), hence \(s(1) = 2\). Similarly, \(s(2) - s(1) = -1\), thus \(s(2) = 1\). Continuing across the interval, we generate the function \(s\) that is pictured at right. Note that the portion of \(s\) from \(t = 2\) to \(t = 3\) is linear because \(v\) is constant there, while the other parts of \(s\) appear to be quadratic, as they correspond to intervals where \(v\) is linear.%

At this point we have used rectangles to estimate the total area underneath a curve.  We will now explore a couple of different ways of constructing these rectangles.  Consider the figures below.  In \hyperref[F-4-1-LH]{Figure~\ref{F-4-1-LH}} the rectangles are formed by setting the height of the rectangle so that the left side of the rectangle touches the curve. Conversely, in \hyperref[F-4-1-RH]{Figure~\ref{F-4-1-RH}} the right side of the rectangle touches the Cuve.  These are commonly called left hand approximations and right hand approximations respectively.%

You might wonder what characteristics of a curve would ensure that a left-hand approximation is always underestimating the total area under the curve.  You could similarly note that in \hyperref[F-4-1-RH]{Figure~\ref{F-4-1-RH}} the right hand approximation gives an overestimate for the total area under the curve.  Again, you might wonder what characteristics of a curve ensure this behavior.%

If we know the velocity of a moving body at every point in a given interval and the velocity is positive throughout, we can estimate the object's distance traveled and in some circumstances determine this value exactly.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-4124}{}%
In particular, when velocity is positive on an interval, we can find the total distance traveled by finding the area under the velocity curve and above the \(t\)-axis on the given time interval. We may only be able to estimate this area, depending on the shape of the velocity curve.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-4125}{}%
An antiderivative of a function \(f\) is a new function \(F\) whose derivative is \(f\). That is, \(F\) is an antiderivative of \(f\) provided that \(F' = f\). In the context of velocity and position, if we know a velocity function \(v\), an antiderivative of \(v\) is a position function \(s\) that satisfies \(s' = v\). If \(v\) is positive on a given interval, say \([a,b]\), then the change in position, \(s(b) - s(a)\), measures the distance the moving object traveled on \([a,b]\).%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-4126}{}%
If its velocity is sometimes negative, a moving object is sometimes traveling in the opposite direction or backtracking. To determine distance traveled, we have to compute the distance separately on intervals where velocity is positive or negative, and account for the change in position on each such interval.%

Along the eastern shore of Lake Michigan from Lake Macatawa (near Holland) to Grand Haven, there is a bike bath that runs almost directly north-south.

\item\hypertarget{li-2675}{}\hypertarget{p-4139}{}%
The velocity function of the biker tells us that for the first hour, the biker pedals north at a velocity of \(11\) miles per hour. At the \(1\)-hour mark, the biker abruptly changes direction and then pedals south at \(10\) miles per hour for the next two hours; finally, at the \(3\)-hour mark, the biker again changes direction and then pedals north at \(9\) mph for the last hour of their trip.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4140}{}%
Thus, the biker traveled \(11\) miles north from their starting point (mile \(1\)) and thus made the turn at \(t = 1\) at mile \(12\). Two hours later, having pedaled south at \(10\) mph, they'd traveled \(20\) miles south, and thus were at mile \(12 - 20 = -8\) relative to Pigeon Lake. Finally, after biking at \(9\) mph north for the lat hour, they were back at mile \(-8 + 9 = 1\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4141}{}%
The furthest north the biker was occurred at time \(t = 1\). This occurs because it is the only time when the derivative of the biker's position function changes from positive to negative, and thus \(s\) has a local maximum. In addition, we can see this based on our discussion above of how far the biker traveled in each direction on the various time intervals, and that the biker was \(12\) miles north of the lake at \(t = 1\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2676}{}\hypertarget{p-4142}{}%
The cyclist's total change in position is \(s(4) - s(0) = 0\). In part (a), we established that \(s(1) = 12\), \(s(3) = -8\), and \(s(4) = 1\). We were given that \(s(0) = 1\). Thus, \(s(4) - s(0) = 0\), and the biker ended up back where they started the trip.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2677}{}\hypertarget{p-4143}{}%
The cyclist first traveled \(11\) miles north, then \(20\) miles south, and finally \(9\) miles north. Since \(11 + 20 + 9 = 40\), their total distance traveled is \(40\) miles, even though their change of position \(0\), as established in (b).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2678}{}\hypertarget{p-4144}{}%
In the following figure, we see an approximate plot of the biker's position function. Since their velocity is constant on the various intervals, their position function is linear on those intervals with slope that matches the velocity. In addition, as pictured, the position function passes through the points we've established above like \((3,-8)\).%

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-2689}{}\hypertarget{p-4158}{}%
Setting \(v(t) = 0\), we find \(500 - 32t = 0\), and thus \(t = \frac{500}{32} = \frac{125}{8} = 15.625\). This is the time that the rocket's velocity changes from positive to negative, and thus the point when the rocket's position changes from increasing to decreasing: it's when the rocket reaches its maximum height.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2690}{}\hypertarget{p-4159}{}%
Since \(v\) is a positive linear function that connects the points \((0,500)\) and \((15.625,0)\) on the interval \([0, 15.625]\), the region enclosed by the velocity function and the \(t\)-axis is a right triangle with vertical leg of length \(500\) and horizontal leg of length \(15.625\). The area of this triangle is \(A = \frac{1}{2}bh = \frac{1}{2}(15.625)(500) = 3906.25\). Because this is the area under the velocity curve (where velocity is positive) this area represents the vertical distance traveled by the rocket on the time interval \([0, 15.625]\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2691}{}\hypertarget{p-4160}{}%
One function that has derivative \(v(t) = s'(t) = 500-32t\) is \(s(t) = 500t - 16t^2\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2692}{}\hypertarget{p-4161}{}%
Using our result in (c), \(s(15.625) - s(0) = 500(15.625) - 16(15.625)^2 - (0 - 0) = 3906.25\). Thus, the change of the rocket's position on \([0,15.625]\) is \(3906.25\) feet, which is also the distance the rocket traveled vertically on the time interval, since velocity is positive throughout.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2693}{}\hypertarget{p-4162}{}%
We find that \(s(5) - s(1) = 1616\), which tells us that the rocket rose \(1616\) feet on the \(4\)-second interval from \(t = 1\) to \(t = 5\).%

\item\hypertarget{li-2702}{}\hypertarget{p-4175}{}%
To find the exact total distance traveled, we need to calculate the area under the velocity function on the interval \([0,2]\). This area is the sum of the areas of the triangular region of height \(1\) and base length \(1\) on the interval \([0,1]\) plus the area of the quarter circle of radius \(1\) on the interval \([1,2]\). So the total distance the object traveled on \(0 \le t \le 2\) is%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{2}(1)(1) + \frac{1}{4} \pi (1^2) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} \pi \approx 1.285\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-2703}{}\hypertarget{p-4176}{}%
The meaning of \(s(5)-s(2)\) is the change in position, or total displacement, of the object on the time interval \([2,5]\). Note that \(s(2)\) was found to be \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} \pi\) in part (a) and%
\begin{equation*}
s(5) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} \pi - \frac{1}{2} - 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{3}{2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
So, \(s(5) - s(2) = -2\), which means that the object moved 2 feet back toward its original position from time \(t=2\) to time \(t=5\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2704}{}\hypertarget{p-4177}{}%
In part (a) we calculated the distance traveled by the object on the interval \([0,2\) to be approximately \(1.285\) feet. On the time interval \([2,4]\), the object is moving in the opposite direction from the motion on the interval \([0,2\), and the total distance traveled is the area \(v(t)\) bounds below the \(t\)-axis on the interval \([2,4\). This area is the sum of the areas of the triangle of height \(1\) and base length \(1\) on the interval \([2,3]\) and the area of the rectangle of height \(1\) and length \(1\) on the interval \([3,4\). So the total distance traveled by the object on the interval \([2,4]\) is%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{2}(1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1.5\text{.}
\end{equation*}
The total distance traveled by the object on the interval \([5,7\) is the area \(v(t)\) bounds above the \(t\)-axis on the interval \([5,7]\). This area is the area of the semicircle of radius \(1\)on the interval \([5,7]\). So the total distance traveled by the object on the interval \([5,7]\) is%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{2}\pi (1)^2 = \frac{\pi}{2} \approx 1.571\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Thus, the object traveled the greatest distance on the time interval \([5,7]\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2705}{}\hypertarget{p-4178}{}%
We know that the position function is increasing when the velocity is positive, so \(s\) is increasing on the intervals \((0,2)\) and \((5,7)\). Since \(v(t)\) is positive to the left of \(t=2\) and then negative to the right of \(t=2\), the position function \(s\) is increasing to the left of \(t=2\) then decreasing to the right of \(t=2\). Thus, the position function has a relative maximum point at \(t=2\). There are no other points with this property, so this is the only relative maximum value of \(s\) on this interval. We also can note that \(s\) increases from \(t=5\) to \(t=7\), culminating in a local maximum value at \(t=7\).%

If we think about an interval on which the rate of pollution is relatively constant and suppose the interval is \(\triangle t\) wide, then the area under the curve on that interval is approximately the area of the rectangle whose width is \(\triangle t\) and whose height is \(p(t)\), the polution rate on that interval. When we compute the product \(p(t) \cdot \triangle t\) to find the area, the units involved are ``units of pollution per day'' times ``days'', which results in an overall unit of ``units of pollution''. Thus, the area under the curve tells us the total pollution emitted over the time interval \([0,30]\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2714}{}\hypertarget{p-4190}{}%
One way to estimate the total amount of pollution is to suppose the rate of pollution is constant on each of the intervals \([0,6]\), \([6,12]\), \(..\)..  For instance, we could assume the rate on \([0,6]\) is always \(7\) units per day, and then the rate jumps to \(8\) units per day on \([6,12]\), and so on. Doing so, and using the ideas we discussed in (b), one estimate for the total pollution, \(P\), is%
\begin{equation*}
P = 7 \cdot 6 + 8 \cdot 6 + 10 \cdot 6 + 13 \cdot 6 + 18 \cdot 6 + 35 \cdot 6 = 546
\end{equation*}
total units of pollution. Note, for example, that when we compute \(13 \cdot 6\) this represents an estimate of the total amount of pollution emitted on the interval \([18,24]\) since we are assuming the plant emits \(13\) units of pollution per day for 6 days. It is apparent that this particular estimate is an underestimate of the total amount of pollution since the rate is always increasing but we are choosing the lowest value of that rate on a given interval.%

In \hyperref[sec-4-1-velocity-distance]{Section~\ref{sec-4-1-velocity-distance}}, we learned that if an object moves with positive velocity \(v\), the area between \(y = v(t)\) and the \(t\)-axis over a given time interval tells us the distance traveled by the object over that time interval. If \(v(t)\) is sometimes negative and we view the area of any region below the \(t\)-axis as having an associated negative sign, then the sum of these signed areas tells us the moving object's change in position over a given time interval.%

Because the motion is in the negative direction on the interval where \(v(t) \lt 0\), we subtract \(A_2\) to determine the object's total change in position.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4197}{}%
Of course, finding \(D\) and \(s(b)-s(a)\) for the graph in \hyperref[F-4-2-Intro]{Figure~\ref{F-4-2-Intro}} presumes that we can actually find the areas \(A_1\), \(A_2\), and \(A_3\). So far, we have worked with velocity functions that were either constant or linear, so that the area bounded by the velocity function and the horizontal axis is a combination of rectangles and triangles, and we can find the area exactly. However, if the curve bounds a region that is not a familiar geometric shape, then we cannot find its area exactly. Indeed, this is one of our biggest goals in \hyperref[C-4]{Chapter~\ref{C-4}}: to learn how to find the exact area bounded between a curve and the horizontal axis for as many different types of functions as possible.%

In \hyperref[act-4-1-1]{Example~\ref{act-4-1-1}}, we approximated the area under a nonlinear velocity function using rectangles. In \hyperref[PA-4-2]{Example~\ref{PA-4-2}}, we consider three different options for the heights of the rectangles we will use.%

A person walking along a straight path has her velocity in miles per hour at time \(t\) given by the function \(v(t) = 0.25t^3-1.5t^2+3t+0.25\), for times in the interval \(0 \le t \le 2\). The graph of this function is also given in each of the three diagrams in \hyperref[F-4-2-PA1]{Figure~\ref{F-4-2-PA1}}.%

The heights of the rectangles are chosen by evaluating the function \(v(t) = 0.25t^3-1.5t^2+3t+0.25\) at the left-hand endpoints.  Specifically,%
\begin{align*}
h_1\amp=v(0) = 0.25(0)^3-1.5(0)^2+3(0)+0.25=0.25\\
h_2\amp=v(0.5) = 0.25(0)^3-1.5(0)^2+3(0)+0.25=1.40625\\

h_4\amp=v(1.5) = 0.25(0)^3-1.5(0)^2+3(0)+0.25=2.21875

Recall that the width of each rectangle is \(0.5\). To determine \(S\), we compute%
\begin{equation*}
A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Then,%
\begin{align*}
A_1 \amp= v(0) \cdot 0.5 = 0.25 \cdot 0.5 = 0.125 \\
A_2 \amp= v(0.5) \cdot 0.5 = 1.40625 \cdot 0.5 = 0.703125 \\
A_3 \amp= v(1) \cdot 0.5 = 2 \cdot 0.5 = 1 \\
A_4 \amp= v(1.5) \cdot 0.5 = 2.21875 \cdot 0.5 = 1.109375

\begin{align*}
S \amp= A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4 \amp= 0.125 + 0.703125 + 1 + 1.109375 \amp= 2.9375

The width of each rectangle is \(0.5\). To determine \(T\), we compute%

B_1 + B_2 + B_3 + B_4\text{.}

Visual inspection of the graphs makes it look like that \(U\) is the best approximation.  The estimate \(S\) is clearly an under-estimate based on the graph; this can be further justified by the computation done in part (a). The estimate \(T\) is clearly an over-estimate based on the graph; this can be further justified by the computation done in part (b).  Hence, the estimate \(U\) is a fairly accurate approximation.%

\subsection[{Sigma Notation}]{Sigma Notation}\label{subsection-107}
\hypertarget{p-4213}{}%
We have used sums of areas of rectangles to approximate the area under a curve. Intuitively, we expect that using a larger number of thinner rectangles will provide a better estimate for the area. Consequently, we anticipate dealing with sums of a large number of terms. To do so, we introduce \emph{sigma notation}, \index{sigma notation} named for the Greek letter \(\Sigma\), which is the capital letter \(S\) in the Greek alphabet.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4214}{}%
For example, say we are interested in the sum%
\begin{equation*}
1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 100\text{,}
\end{equation*}
i.e. the sum of the first 100 natural numbers. In sigma notation, we write%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=1}^{100} k =  1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 100\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4215}{}%
We read the symbol \(\sum_{k=1}^{100} k\) as ``the sum from \(k\) equals 1 to 100 of \(k\).'' The variable \(k\) is called the index of summation, and any letter can be used for this variable. The pattern in the terms of the sum is denoted by a function of the index; for example,%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=1}^{10} (k^2 + 2k) =  (1^2 + 2\cdot 1) + (2^2 + 2\cdot 2) + (3^2 + 2\cdot 3) + \cdots + (10^2 + 2\cdot 10)\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and more generally,%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=1}^n f(k) = f(1) + f(2) + \cdots + f(n)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4216}{}%
Sigma notation allows us to vary easily the function being used to describe the terms in the sum, and to adjust the number of terms in the sum simply by changing the value of \(n\). We test our understanding of this new notation in the following example.%
\begin{example}[]\label{act-4-2-1}

When a moving body has a positive velocity function \(y = v(t)\) on a given interval \([a,b]\), the area under the curve over the interval gives the total distance the body travels on \([a,b]\). We are also interested in finding the exact area bounded by \(y = f(x)\) on an interval \([a,b]\), regardless of the meaning or context of the function \(f\). For now, we continue to focus on finding an accurate estimate of this area by using a sum of the areas of rectangles. Unless otherwise indicated, we assume that \(f\) is continuous and non-negative on \([a,b]\).%

The first choice we make in such an approximation is the number of rectangles.%

\hypertarget{p-4243}{}%
If we desire \(n\) rectangles of equal width to subdivide the interval \([a,b]\), then each rectangle must have width \(\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}\). We let \(x_0 = a\), \(x_n = b\), and define \(x_{i} = a + i\Delta x\), so that \(x_1 = x_0 + \Delta x\), \(x_2 = x_0 + 2 \Delta x\), and so on, as pictured in \hyperref[F-4-2-Interval]{Figure~\ref{F-4-2-Interval}}.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4244}{}%
We use each subinterval \([x_i, x_{i+1}]\) as the base of a rectangle, and next choose the height of the rectangle on that subinterval. There are three standard choices: we can use the left endpoint of each subinterval, the right endpoint of each subinterval, or the midpoint of each. These are precisely the options encountered in \hyperref[PA-4-2]{Example~\ref{PA-4-2}} and seen in \hyperref[F-4-2-PA1]{Figure~\ref{F-4-2-PA1}}. We next explore how these choices can be described in sigma notation.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4245}{}%
Consider an arbitrary positive function \(f\) on \([a,b]\) with the interval subdivided as shown in \hyperref[F-4-2-Interval]{Figure~\ref{F-4-2-Interval}}, and choose to use left endpoints. Then on each interval \([x_{i}, x_{i+1}]\), the area of the rectangle formed is given by%
\begin{equation*}
A_{i+1} = f(x_i) \cdot \Delta x\text{,}
\end{equation*}
as seen in \hyperref[F-4-2-LeftSum]{Figure~\ref{F-4-2-LeftSum}}.%

\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-4246}{}%
If we let \(L_n\) denote the sum of the areas of these rectangles, we see that%
\begin{align*}
L_n =\mathstrut \amp  A_1 + A_2 + \cdots + A_{i+1} + \cdots + A_n\\
=\mathstrut \amp  f(x_0) \cdot \Delta x + f(x_1) \cdot \Delta x + \cdots + f(x_i) \cdot \Delta x + \cdots + f(x_{n-1}) \cdot \Delta x\text{.}
\end{align*}
In the more compact sigma notation, we have%
\begin{equation*}
L_n = \sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} f(x_i) \Delta x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4247}{}%
Note that since the index of summation begins at \(0\) and ends at \(n-1\), there are indeed \(n\) terms in this sum. We call \(L_n\) the \emph{left Riemann sum} \index{Riemann sum} \index{Riemann sum!left} for the function \(f\) on the interval \([a,b]\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4248}{}%
To see how the Riemann sums for right endpoints and midpoints are constructed, we consider \hyperref[F-4-2-RightMidSum]{Figure~\ref{F-4-2-RightMidSum}}.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/4_2_RightMidSum.pdf}
\caption{Riemann sums using right endpoints and midpoints.\label{F-4-2-RightMidSum}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-4249}{}%
For the sum with right endpoints, we see that the area of the rectangle on an arbitrary interval \([x_i, x_{i+1}]\) is given by \(B_{i+1} = f(x_{i+1}) \cdot \Delta x\), and that the sum of all such areas of rectangles is given by%
\begin{align*}
R_n =\mathstrut \amp  B_1 + B_2 + \cdots + B_{i+1} + \cdots + B_n\\
=\mathstrut \amp  f(x_1) \cdot \Delta x + f(x_2) \cdot \Delta x + \cdots + f(x_{i+1}) \cdot \Delta x + \cdots + f(x_{n}) \cdot \Delta x\\
=\mathstrut \amp  \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i) \Delta x\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4250}{}%
We call \(R_n\) the \emph{right Riemann sum} \index{Riemann sum!right} for the function \(f\) on the interval \([a,b]\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4251}{}%
For the sum that uses midpoints, we introduce the notation%
\begin{equation*}
\overline{x}_{i+1} = \frac{x_{i} + x_{i+1}}{2}
\end{equation*}
so that \(\overline{x}_{i+1}\) is the midpoint of the interval \([x_i, x_{i+1}]\). For instance, for the rectangle with area \(C_1\) in \hyperref[F-4-2-RightMidSum]{Figure~\ref{F-4-2-RightMidSum}}, we now have%
\begin{equation*}
C_1 = f(\overline{x}_1) \cdot \Delta x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4252}{}%
Hence, the sum of all the areas of rectangles that use midpoints is%
\begin{align*}
M_n =\mathstrut \amp  C_1 + C_2 + \cdots + C_{i+1} + \cdots + C_n\\
=\mathstrut \amp  f(\overline{x_1}) \cdot \Delta x + f(\overline{x_2}) \cdot \Delta x + \cdots + f(\overline{x}_{i+1}) \cdot \Delta x + \cdots + f(\overline{x}_{n}) \cdot \Delta x\\
=\mathstrut \amp  \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(\overline{x}_i) \Delta x\text{,}
\end{align*}
and we say that \(M_n\) is the \emph{middle Riemann sum} \index{Riemann sum!middle} for \(f\) on \([a,b]\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4253}{}%
Thus, we have two variables to explore: the number of rectangles and the height of each rectangle. We can explore these choices dynamically, and the applet\footnote{Marc Renault, Geogebra Calculus Applets.\label{fn-45}} found at \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/a9}{http://gvsu.edu/s/a9} is a particularly useful one. There we see the image shown in \hyperref[F-4-2-RenaultAppletRS]{Figure~\ref{F-4-2-RenaultAppletRS}}, but with the opportunity to adjust the slider bars for the heights and the number of rectangles.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.71\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/4_2_RenaultAppletRS.pdf}

\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-4254}{}%
By moving the sliders, we can see how the heights of the rectangles change as we consider left endpoints, midpoints, and right endpoints, as well as the impact that a larger number of narrower rectangles has on the approximation of the exact area bounded by the function and the horizontal axis.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4255}{}%
When \(f(x) \ge 0\) on \([a,b]\), each of the Riemann sums \(L_n\), \(R_n\), and \(M_n\) provides an estimate of the area under the curve \(y = f(x)\) over the interval \([a,b]\). We also recall that in the context of a nonnegative velocity function \(y = v(t)\), the corresponding Riemann sums approximate the distance traveled on \([a,b]\) by a moving object with velocity function \(v\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4256}{}%
There is a more general way to think of Riemann sums, and that is to allow any choice of where the function is evaluated to determine the rectangle heights. Rather than saying we'll always choose left endpoints, or always choose midpoints, we simply say that a point \(x_{i+1}^*\) will be selected at random in the interval \([x_i, x_{i+1}]\) (so that \(x_i \le x_{i+1}^* \le x_{i+1}\)). The Riemann sum is then given by%
\begin{equation*}
f(x_1^*) \cdot \Delta x + f(x_2^*) \cdot \Delta x + \cdots + f(x_{i+1}^*) \cdot \Delta x + \cdots + f(x_n^*) \cdot \Delta x = \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \Delta x\text{.}
\end{equation*}

At \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/a9}{http://gvsu.edu/s/a9}, the applet noted earlier and referenced in \hyperref[F-4-2-RenaultAppletRS]{Figure~\ref{F-4-2-RenaultAppletRS}}, by unchecking the ``relative'' box at the top left, and instead checking ``random,'' we can easily explore the effect of using random point locations in subintervals on a Riemann sum. In computational practice, we most often use \(L_n\), \(R_n\), or \(M_n\), while the random Riemann sum is useful in theoretical discussions. In the following example, we investigate several different Riemann sums for a particular velocity function.%
\begin{example}[]\label{act-4-2-2}

\end{equation*}
This average actually measures what would result from using four trapezoids, rather than rectangles, to estimate the area on each subinterval. One reason this is so is because the area of a trapezoid is the average of the bases times the width, and the ``bases'' are given by the function values at the left and right endpoints.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2764}{}\hypertarget{p-4276}{}%
If \(f\) is positive and increasing on \([a,b]\), \(L_n\) will under-estimate the exact area under \(f\) on \([a,b]\). Because \(f\) is increasing, its value at the left endpoint of any subinterval will be lower than every other function value in the interval, and thus the rectangle with that height lies exclusively below the curve. In a similar way, \(R_n\) over-estimates the exact area under \(f\) on \([a,b]\).%

For a Riemann sum such as%
\begin{equation*}
L_n = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f(x_i) \Delta x\text{,}
\end{equation*}
we can of course compute the sum even when \(f\) takes on negative values. We know that when \(f\) is positive on \([a,b]\), a Riemann sum estimates the area bounded between \(f\) and the horizontal axis over the interval.%

\hypertarget{p-4278}{}%
For the function pictured in the first graph of \hyperref[F-4-2-NegF]{Figure~\ref{F-4-2-NegF}}, a left Riemann sum with 12 subintervals over \([a,d]\) is shown. The function is negative on the interval \(b \le x \le c\), so at the four left endpoints that fall in \([b,c]\), the terms \(f(x_i) \Delta x\) are negative. This means that those four terms in the Riemann sum produce an estimate of the \emph{opposite} of the area bounded by \(y = f(x)\) and the \(x\)-axis on \([b,c]\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4279}{}%
In the middle graph of \hyperref[F-4-2-NegF]{Figure~\ref{F-4-2-NegF}}, we see that by increasing the number of rectangles the approximation of the area (or the opposite of the area) bounded by the curve appears to improve.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4280}{}%
In general, any Riemann sum of a continuous function \(f\) on an interval \([a,b]\) approximates the difference between the area that lies above the horizontal axis on \([a,b]\) and under \(f\) and the area that lies below the horizontal axis on \([a,b]\) and above \(f\). In the notation of \hyperref[F-4-2-NegF]{Figure~\ref{F-4-2-NegF}}, we may say that%
\begin{equation*}
L_{24} \approx A_1 - A_2 + A_3\text{,}
\end{equation*}
where \(L_{24}\) is the left Riemann sum using 24 subintervals shown in the middle graph. \(A_1\) and \(A_3\) are the areas of the regions where \(f\) is positive, and \(A_2\) is the area where \(f\) is negative. We will call the quantity \(A_1 - A_2 + A_3\) the \emph{net signed area} \index{net signed area} bounded by \(f\) over the interval \([a,d]\), where by the phrase ``signed area'' we indicate that we are attaching a minus sign to the areas of regions that fall below the horizontal axis.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4281}{}%
Finally, we recall that if the function \(f\) represents the velocity of a moving object, the sum of the areas bounded by the curve tells us the total distance traveled over the relevant time interval, while the net signed area bounded by the curve computes the object's change in position on the interval.%
\begin{example}[]\label{act-4-2-3}
\hypertarget{p-4282}{}%
Suppose that an object moving along a straight line path has its velocity \(v\) (in feet per second) at time \(t\) (in seconds) given by%

Since the net signed area bounded by \(v\) on \([1,5]\) represents the total change in position of the object on the interval \([1,5]\), it follows that \(M_5\) estimates the total change in position. Hence, the change in position is approximately \(-1.44\) feet.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2779}{}\hypertarget{p-4300}{}%
To estimate the total distance traveled by the object on \([1,5]\), we have to calculate the total area between the curve and the \(t\)-axis. Thus,%
\begin{equation*}
D \approx \frac{7}{25} \cdot \frac{4}{5} + \frac{17}{25} \cdot \frac{4}{5} + 1 \cdot \frac{4}{5} + \frac{17}{25} \cdot \frac{4}{5} +  \frac{7}{25} \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{292}{125} \approx 2.336\text{.}

\item\hypertarget{li-2780}{}\hypertarget{p-4301}{}%
Using appropriate technology, \(M_{10} = -1.36\) and \(M_{20} = -1.34\). Further calculations suggest that \(M_n \to -\frac{4}{3} = -1.\overline{33}\) as \(n \to \infty\), and this number represents the object's total change in position on \([1,5]\).%

\item{}\hypertarget{p-4303}{}%
A Riemann sum is simply a sum of products of the form \(f(x_i^*) \Delta x\) that estimates the area between a positive function and the horizontal axis over a given interval. If the function is sometimes negative on the interval, the Riemann sum estimates the difference between the areas that lie above the horizontal axis and those that lie below the axis.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-4304}{}%
The three most common types of Riemann sums are left, right, and middle sums, but we can also work with a more general Riemann sum. The only difference among these sums is the location of the point at which the function is evaluated to determine the height of the rectangle whose area is being computed. For a left Riemann sum, we evaluate the function at the left endpoint of each subinterval, while for right and middle sums, we use right endpoints and midpoints, respectively.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-4305}{}%
The left, right, and middle Riemann sums are denoted \(L_n\), \(R_n\), and \(M_n\), with formulas%
\begin{align*}
L_n = f(x_0) \Delta x + f(x_1) \Delta x + \cdots + f(x_{n-1}) \Delta x \amp= \sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} f(x_i) \Delta x,\\
R_n = f(x_1) \Delta x + f(x_2) \Delta x + \cdots + f(x_{n}) \Delta x \amp= \sum_{i = 1}^{n} f(x_i) \Delta x,\\
M_n = f(\overline{x}_1) \Delta x + f(\overline{x}_2) \Delta x + \cdots + f(\overline{x}_{n}) \Delta x \amp= \sum_{i = 1}^{n} f(\overline{x}_i) \Delta x\text{,}
\end{align*}
where \(x_0 = a\), \(x_i = a + i\Delta x\), and \(x_n = b\), using \(\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}\). For the midpoint sum, \(\overline{x}_{i} = \frac{x_{i-1} + x_i}{2}\).%

Since we are using \(4\) subintervals on \([2,5]\), it follows that \(\triangle x = \frac{5-2}{4} = 0.75\). Thus, \(x_0 = 2\), \(x_1 = 2.75\), \(x_2 = 3.5\), \(x_3 = 4.25\), and \(x_4 = 5\). The midpoints of the respective subintervals are thus \(\overline{x_1} = \frac{2+2.75}{2} = 2.375\), \(\overline{x_2} = 3.125\), \(\overline{x_3} = 3.875\), and \(\overline{x_4} = 4.625\). Thus,%
\begin{align*}
M_4 &= f(\overline{x_1}) \cdot \triangle x + f(\overline{x_2}) \cdot \triangle x + f(\overline{x_3}) \cdot \triangle x + f(\overline{x_4}) \cdot \triangle x\\
&= \left(f(2.375) + f(3.125) + f(3.875) + f(4.625) \right) \cdot (0.75)\\
&= \left(11.125 + 13.375 + 15.625 + 17.875 \right) \cdot (0.75)\\
&= 58 \cdot 0.75\\
&= 43.5

Observe that \(f(2) = 10\) and \(f(5) = 19\). The region bounded by the function, the \(x\)-axis, and the endpoints is a trapezoid. Recalling that the area of a trapezoid is the average of the bases times the height, we see that the bounded region has area%

A = \frac{1}{2}(10 + 19)(5-2) = \frac{87}{2}\text{.}

\item\hypertarget{li-2794}{}\hypertarget{p-4320}{}%
The reason that \(M_4\) gives the exact area between the line and the \(x\)-axis is the rectangles with heights that come from the midpoint have the same area as the trapezoids that are formed by the function values at the two endpoints of each subinterval. We can also see this by observing that the ``extra area'' bounded by the midpoint rectangle exactly matches the ``missing area'' that is absent from the midpoint rectangle, as seen in the following figure. Since these two quantities balance out, the areas of the midpoint rectangles give us the exact area under the curve.%

Indeed, the value of \(M_n\) will give the exact area under \(g\) on \([2,5]\) for any value of \(n\). But neither \(L_n\) nor \(R_n\) will be exact: \(L_n\) will underestimate the true area since every rectangle will lie completely under the function \(g\), whereas \(R_n\) will overestimate because every rectangle lies above the function.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2795}{}\hypertarget{p-4322}{}%
For any linear function \(g\) of the form \(g(x) = mx + b\) such that \(g(x) \ge 0\) on the interval of interest, the midpoint rule will give the exact value of the area bounded by the function and the \(x\)-axis. This is true because the area of the trapezoid formed by the two endpoints on a given subinterval will be the same as the area of the rectangle whose height is given by the function at the midpoint of the subinterval.%

The function is being evaluated at \(x_1 = 1.4\), \(x_2 = 1.8\), \(x_3 = 2.2\), \(x_4 = 2.6\), and \(x_5 = 3.0\). Thus, since we know this is a right Riemann sum, we are using \(5\) subintervals with \(\triangle x = 0.4\), and \(x_0 = 1.0\).

Given that \(r\) is an increasing function, a right sum will always give us an overestimate of the total amount of pollution (in tons) on the interval \([0,4]\). We use computational technology to compute a few right sums: \(R_{10} \approx 7.049244376\), \(R_{50} \approx 6.517689073\), \(R_{100} \approx 6.453159616\), \(R_{500} \approx 6.401842731\). These sums don't seem to change in the tens place as we make \(n\) sufficiently large, so an upper bound on the total amount of pollution on the interval \([0,4]\) that is accurate to within one ton is \(6.4\) tons.%

How does increasing the number of subintervals affect the accuracy of the approximation generated by a Riemann sum?%

\end{itemize}
\end{objectives}
\hypertarget{p-4373}{}%
In \hyperref[F-4-3-IncreaseN]{Figure~\ref{F-4-3-IncreaseN}}, we see evidence that increasing the number of rectangles in a Riemann sum improves the accuracy of the approximation of the net signed area bounded by the given function.%

\hypertarget{p-4374}{}%
We therefore explore the natural idea of allowing the number of rectangles to increase without bound. In an effort to compute the exact net signed area we also consider the differences among left, right, and middle Riemann sums and the different results they generate as the value of \(n\) increases. We begin with functions that are exclusively positive on the interval under consideration.%

In \hyperref[F-4-3-IncreaseN]{Figure~\ref{F-4-3-IncreaseN}}, we saw that as the number of rectangles got larger and larger, the values of \(L_n\) converge to some value. It turns out that any continuous function on an interval \([a,b]\), \(L_n\) and \(R_n\) will converge to the same value as \(n\) grows larger. In fact, for any continuous function and a Riemann sum using any point \(x_{i+1}^*\) in the interval \([x_i, x_{i+1}]\), \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \Delta x\) will converge to that same value. Thus, as we let \(n \to \infty\), it doesn't really matter where we choose to evaluate the function within a given subinterval, because%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{n \to \infty} L_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} R_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} M_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \Delta x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4376}{}%
The fact that these limits always exist (and share the same value) when \(f\) is continuous\footnote{It turns out that a function need not be continuous in order to have a definite integral. For our purposes, we assume that the functions we consider are continuous on the interval(s) of interest. It is straightforward to see that any function that is piecewise continuous on an interval of interest will also have a well-defined definite integral.\label{fn-47}} allows us to make the following definition.%
\begin{assemblage}\label{D-4-3-DefInt}
\hypertarget{p-4377}{}%
The \terminology{definite integral} of a continuous function \(f\) on the interval \([a,b]\), denoted \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\), is the real number given by%
\begin{equation*}
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \Delta x\text{,}
\end{equation*}
where \(\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}\), \(x_i = a + i\Delta x\) (for \(i = 0, \ldots, n\)), and \(x_i^*\) satisfies \(x_{i-1} \le x_i^* \le x_i\) (for \(i = 1, \ldots, n\)).%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-4378}{}%
We call the symbol \(\int\) the \emph{integral sign}, \index{integral sign} the values \(a\) and \(b\) the \emph{limits of integration}, \index{limits of integration} and the function \(f\) the \emph{integrand} \index{integrand} The process of determining the real number \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\) is called \emph{evaluating the definite integral}. While there are several different interpretations of the definite integral, for now the most important is that \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\) measures the net signed area bounded by \(y = f(x)\) and the \(x\)-axis on the interval \([a,b]\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4379}{}%
For example, if \(f\) is the function pictured in \hyperref[F-4-3-DefIntInterp]{Figure~\ref{F-4-3-DefIntInterp}}, and \(A_1\), \(A_2\), and \(A_3\) are the exact areas bounded by \(f\) and the \(x\)-axis on the respective intervals \([a,b]\), \([b,c]\), and \([c,d]\), then%
\begin{gather*}
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = A_1, \ \int_b^c f(x) \, dx = -A_2,\\
\int_c^d f(x) \, dx = A_3,\\
\text{ and } \int_a^d f(x) \, dx = A_1 - A_2 + A_3\text{.}
\end{gather*}
%

\caption{A continuous function \(f\) on the interval \([a,d]\).\label{F-4-3-DefIntInterp}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-4380}{}%
We can also use definite integrals to express the change in position and the distance traveled by a moving object. If \(v\) is a velocity function on an interval \([a,b]\), then the change in position of the object, \(s(b) - s(a)\), is given by%
\begin{equation*}
s(b) - s(a) = \int_a^b v(t) \, dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4381}{}%
If the velocity function is nonnegative on \([a,b]\), then \(\int_a^b v(t) \,dt\) tells us the distance the object traveled. If the velocity is sometimes negative on \([a,b]\), we can use definite integrals to find the areas bounded by the function on each interval where \(v\) does not change sign, and the sum of these areas will tell us the distance the object traveled.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4382}{}%
To compute the value of a definite integral from the definition, we have to take the limit of a sum. While this is possible to do in select circumstances, it is also tedious and time-consuming, and does not offer much additional insight into the meaning or interpretation of the definite integral. Instead, in \hyperref[sec-4-4-FTC]{Section~\ref{sec-4-4-FTC}}, we will learn the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which provides a shortcut for evaluating a large class of definite integrals. This will enable us to determine the exact net signed area bounded by a continuous function and the \(x\)-axis in many circumstances.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4383}{}%
For now, our goal is to understand the meaning and properties of the definite integral, rather than to compute its value. To do this, we will rely on the net signed area interpretation of the definite integral. So we will use as examples curves that produce regions whose areas we can compute exactly through area formulas. We can thus compute the exact value of the corresponding integral.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4384}{}%
For instance, if we wish to evaluate the definite integral \(\int_1^4 (2x+1) \, dx\), we observe that the region bounded by this function and the \(x\)-axis is the trapezoid shown in \hyperref[F-4-3-TrapArea]{Figure~\ref{F-4-3-TrapArea}}. By the formula for the area of a trapezoid, \(A = \frac{1}{2}(3+9) \cdot 3 = 18\), so%
\begin{equation*}
\int_1^4 (2x+1) \, dx = 18\text{.}

\hypertarget{p-4385}{}%
Regarding the definite integral of a function \(f\) over an interval \([a,b]\) as the net signed area bounded by \(f\) and the \(x\)-axis, we discover several standard properties of the definite integral. It is helpful to remember that the definite integral is defined in terms of Riemann sums, which consist of the areas of rectangles.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4386}{}%
For any real number \(a\) and the definite integral \(\int_a^a f(x) \, dx\) it is evident that no area is enclosed, because the interval begins and ends with the same point. Hence,%
\begin{assemblage}\label{assemblage-98}
\hypertarget{p-4387}{}%
If \(f\) is a continuous function and \(a\) is a real number, then \(\int_a^a f(x) \,dx = 0\).%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-4388}{}%
Next, we consider the result of subdividing the interval of integration. In \hyperref[F-4-3-AdditiveProp]{Figure~\ref{F-4-3-AdditiveProp}}, we see that%
\begin{gather*}
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = A_1, \ \int_b^c f(x) \, dx = A_2,\\
\text{and }\int_a^c f(x) \, dx = A_1 + A_2\text{,}
\end{gather*}
which illustrates the following general rule.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.47\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/4_3_AdditiveProp.pdf}
\caption{The area bounded by \(y=f(x)\) on the interval \([a,c]\).\label{F-4-3-AdditiveProp}}
\end{figure}
\begin{assemblage}\label{assemblage-99}
\hypertarget{p-4389}{}%
If \(f\) is a continuous function and \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are real numbers, then%
\begin{equation*}
\int_a^c f(x) \,dx = \int_a^b f(x) \,dx + \int_b^c f(x) \,dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-4390}{}%
While this rule is easy to see if \(a \lt b \lt c\), it in fact holds in general for any values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Another property of the definite integral states that if we reverse the order of the limits of integration, we change the sign of the integral's value.%
\begin{assemblage}\label{assemblage-100}
\hypertarget{p-4391}{}%
If \(f\) is a continuous function and \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers, then%
\begin{equation*}
\int_b^a f(x) \,dx = -\int_a^b f(x) \,dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-4392}{}%
This result makes sense because if we integrate from \(a\) to \(b\), then in the defining Riemann sum we set \(\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}\), while if we integrate from \(b\) to \(a\), we have \(\Delta x = \frac{a-b}{n} = -\frac{b-a}{n}\), and this is the only change in the sum used to define the integral.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4393}{}%
There are two additional useful properties of the definite integral. When we worked with derivative rules in \hyperref[C-2]{Chapter~\ref{C-2}}, we formulated the Constant Multiple Rule and the Sum Rule. Recall that the Constant Multiple Rule says that if \(f\) is a differentiable function and \(k\) is a constant, then%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx} [kf(x)] = kf'(x)\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and the Sum Rule says that if \(f\) and \(g\) are differentiable functions, then%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx}[f(x) + g(x)] = f'(x) + g'(x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4394}{}%
These rules are useful because they allow to deal individually with the simplest parts of certain functions by taking advantage of addition and multiplying by a constant. In other words, the process of taking the derivative respects addition and multiplying by constants in the simplest possible way.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4395}{}%
It turns out that similar rules hold for the definite integral. First, let's consider the functions pictured in \hyperref[F-4-3-ConstMult]{Figure~\ref{F-4-3-ConstMult}}.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/4_3_ConstMult.pdf}
\caption{The areas bounded by \(y = f(x)\) and \(y = 2f(x)\) on \([a,b]\).\label{F-4-3-ConstMult}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-4396}{}%
Because multiplying the function by 2 doubles its height at every \(x\)-value, we see that the height of each rectangle in a left Riemann sum is doubled, \(f(x_i)\) for the original function, versus \(2f(x_i)\) in the doubled function. For the areas \(A\) and \(B\), it follows \(B = 2A\). As this is true regardless of the value of \(n\) or the type of sum we use, we see that in the limit, the area of the red region bounded by \(y = 2f(x)\) will be twice the area of the blue region bounded by \(y = f(x)\). As there is nothing special about the value \(2\) compared to an arbitrary constant \(k\), the following general principle holds.%
\begin{assemblage}[Constant Multiple Rule]\label{assemblage-101}
\hypertarget{p-4397}{}%
If \(f\) is a continuous function and \(k\) is any real number, then%
\begin{equation*}
\int_a^b k \cdot f(x) \,dx = k \int_a^b f(x) \,dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-4398}{}%
We see a similar situation with the sum of two functions \(f\) and \(g\).%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/4_3_Sum.pdf}
\caption{The areas bounded by \(y = f(x)\) and \(y = g(x)\) on \([a,b]\), as well as the area bounded by \(y = f(x) + g(x)\).\label{F-4-3-Sum}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-4399}{}%
If we take the sum of two functions \(f\) and \(g\) at every point in the interval, the height of the function \(f+g\) is given by \((f+g)(x_i) = f(x_i) + g(x_i)\). Hence, for the pictured rectangles with areas \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\), it follows that \(C = A + B\). Because this will occur for every such rectangle, in the limit the area of the gray region will be the sum of the areas of the blue and red regions. In terms of definite integrals, we have the following general rule.%
\begin{assemblage}[Sum Rule]\label{assemblage-102}
\hypertarget{p-4400}{}%
If \(f\) and \(g\) are continuous functions, then%
\begin{equation*}
\int_a^b [f(x) + g(x)] \,dx = \int_a^b f(x) \,dx + \int_a^b g(x) \,dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-4401}{}%
The Constant Multiple and Sum Rules can be combined to say that for any continuous functions \(f\) and \(g\) and any constants \(c\) and \(k\),%
\begin{equation*}
\int_a^b [c f(x) \pm k g(x)] \,dx = c \int_a^b f(x) \,dx \pm k \int_a^b g(x) \,dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}

The line creates two triangles, one with area \(A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 \cdot 4 = 4\) and the other with area \(A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 3 \cdot 6 = 9\). Since the latter area corresponds to a region below the \(x\)-axis, we associate a negative sign to it, and hence find that%

Observe that on \([-3,-2]\), the bounded area is \(\frac{1}{2}\). On \([-2,-1]\), the area is \(\frac{1}{4} \pi\). Similarly, on the next five subintervals of length 1, the areas bounded are respectively \(\frac{1}{2}\), \(1\), \(\frac{1}{2}\), \(\frac{1}{4} \pi\), and \(\frac{1}{4} \pi\). Thus, the value of the integral is%
\begin{equation*}
\int_{-3}^4 g(x) \, dx = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{1}{2} - 1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{3\pi}{4} - \frac{3}{2}\text{,}

\index{average value of a function}\hypertarget{p-4453}{}%
One of the most valuable applications of the definite integral is that it provides a way to discuss the average value of a function, even for a function that takes on infinitely many values. Recall that if we wish to take the average of \(n\) numbers \(y_1\), \(y_2\), \(\ldots\), \(y_n\), we compute%
\begin{equation*}
AVG  = \frac{y_1 + y_2 + \cdots + y_n}{n}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4454}{}%
Since integrals arise from Riemann sums in which we add \(n\) values of a function, it should not be surprising that evaluating an integral is similar to averaging the output values of a function. Consider, for instance, the right Riemann sum \(R_n\) of a function \(f\), which is given by%
\begin{equation*}
R_n = f(x_1) \Delta x + f(x_2) \Delta x + \cdots + f(x_n) \Delta x = (f(x_1) + f(x_2) + \cdots + f(x_n))\Delta x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4455}{}%
Since \(\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}\), we can thus write%
\begin{align}
R_n =\mathstrut \amp (f(x_1) + f(x_2) + \cdots + f(x_n))\cdot \frac{b-a}{n}\notag\\
=\mathstrut \amp (b-a) \frac{f(x_1) + f(x_2) + \cdots + f(x_n)}{n}\text{.}\label{E-RAvg}
\end{align}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4456}{}%
We see that the right Riemann sum with \(n\) subintervals is just the length of the interval \((b-a)\) times the average of the \(n\) function values found at the right endpoints. And just as with our efforts to compute area, the larger the value of \(n\) we use, the more accurate our average will be. Indeed, we will define the average value of \(f\) on \([a,b]\) to be%
\begin{equation*}
f_{\operatorname{AVG} [a,b]} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{f(x_1) + f(x_2) + \cdots + f(x_n)}{n}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4457}{}%
But we also know that for any continuous function \(f\) on \([a,b]\), taking the limit of a Riemann sum leads precisely to the definite integral. That is, \(\lim_{n \to \infty} R_n = \int_a^b f(x) \, dx\), and thus taking the limit as \(n \to \infty\) in \hyperref[E-RAvg]{Equation~(\ref{E-RAvg})}, we have that%
\begin{equation}
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = (b-a) \cdot f_{\operatorname{AVG} [a,b]}\text{.}\label{E-RAvg2}
\end{equation}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4458}{}%
Solving Equation~\hyperref[E-RAvg2]{(\ref{E-RAvg2})} for \(f_{\operatorname{AVG} [a,b]}\), we have the following general principle.%
\begin{assemblage}[Average value of a function]\label{average-value}
\hypertarget{p-4459}{}%
\index{average value} If \(f\) is a continuous function on \([a,b]\), then its average value on \([a,b]\) is given by the formula%
\begin{equation*}
f_{\operatorname{AVG} [a,b]} = \frac{1}{b-a} \cdot \int_a^b f(x) \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-4460}{}%
Equation~\hyperref[E-RAvg2]{(\ref{E-RAvg2})} tells us another way to interpret the definite integral: the definite integral of a function \(f\) from \(a\) to \(b\) is the length of the interval \((b-a)\) times the average value of the function on the interval. In addition, when the function \(f\) is nonnegative on \([a,b]\), Equation~\hyperref[E-RAvg2]{(\ref{E-RAvg2})} has a natural visual interpretation.%

Consider \hyperref[F-4-3-AvgVal]{Figure~\ref{F-4-3-AvgVal}}, where we see at left the shaded region whose area is \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\), at center the shaded rectangle whose dimensions are \((b-a)\) by \(f_{\operatorname{AVG} [a,b]}\), and at right these two figures superimposed. Note that in dark green we show the horizontal line \(y = f_{\operatorname{AVG} [a,b]}\). Thus, the area of the green rectangle is given by \((b-a) \cdot f_{\operatorname{AVG} [a,b]}\), which is precisely the value of \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\). The area of the blue region in the left figure is the same as the area of the green rectangle in the center figure. We can also observe that the areas \(A_1\) and \(A_2\) in the rightmost figure appear to be equal. Thus, knowing the average value of a function enables us to construct a rectangle whose area is the same as the value of the definite integral of the function on the interval. The java applet\footnote{David Austin, \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/5r}{http://gvsu.edu/s/5r}.\label{fn-48}} at \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/az}{http://gvsu.edu/s/az} provides an opportunity to explore how the average value of the function changes as the interval changes, through an image similar to that found in \hyperref[F-4-3-AvgVal]{Figure~\ref{F-4-3-AvgVal}}.%

\item\hypertarget{li-2894}{}\hypertarget{p-4485}{}%
Thus, the value of \(\int_0^4 v(t) \, dt\) is the area of a semicircle of radius 2, which is \(\frac{1}{2} \pi (2)^2 = 2\pi\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2895}{}\hypertarget{p-4486}{}%
Because the velocity \(v(t)\) is always nonnegative in this problem, the meaning of \(\int_0^4 v(t) \, dt = 2\pi\) is both the distance traveled and the change in position of the object on the interval \(0 \le t \le \pi\). Specifically, the object moved \(2 \pi\) meters in 4 minutes.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2896}{}\hypertarget{p-4487}{}%
We know \(v_{\text{AVG} }[a,b] = \frac{1}{b-a}  \int_a^b v(t) \, dt\), so%
\begin{equation*}
v_{\text{AVG} }[0,4] = \frac{1}{4-0}  \int_0^4 \sqrt{4-(t-2)^2} \, dt = \frac{1}{4} 2\pi = \frac{\pi}{2}\text{,}

The height of the rectangle is the average value of \(v\), specifically \(v_{\text{AVG} }[0,4] = \frac{\pi}{2} \approx 1.57\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2898}{}\hypertarget{p-4490}{}%
Knowing that average velocity is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), it follows from the fact that distance traveled equals average rate times time (provided velocity is always nonnegative), we have%
\begin{equation*}
D = \frac{\pi}{2} \cdot 4 = 2\pi\text{.}
\end{equation*}
We see from (c) or (f) that we are simply considering the situation from two different perspectives: if we know the distance traveled, we can find average velocity, or if we know average velocity, we can find distance traveled.%

\item{}\hypertarget{p-4492}{}%
Any Riemann sum of a continuous function \(f\) on an interval \([a,b]\) provides an estimate of the net signed area bounded by the function and the horizontal axis on the interval. Increasing the number of subintervals in the Riemann sum improves the accuracy of this estimate, and letting the number of subintervals increase without bound results in the values of the corresponding Riemann sums approaching the exact value of the enclosed net signed area.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-4493}{}%
When we take the limit of Riemann sums, we arrive at what we call the definite integral of \(f\) over the interval \([a,b]\). In particular, the symbol \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\) denotes the definite integral of \(f\) over \([a,b]\), and this quantity is defined by the equation%
\begin{equation*}
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \Delta x\text{,}
\end{equation*}
where \(\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}\), \(x_i = a + i\Delta x\) (for \(i = 0, \ldots, n\)), and \(x_i^*\) satisfies \(x_{i-1} \le x_i^* \le x_i\) (for \(i = 1, \ldots, n\)).%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-4494}{}%
The definite integral \(\int_a^b f(x) \,dx\) measures the exact net signed area bounded by \(f\) and the horizontal axis on \([a,b]\); in addition, the value of the definite integral is related to what we call the average value of the function on \([a,b]\): \(f_{\text{AVG} [a,b]} = \frac{1}{b-a} \cdot \int_a^b f(x) \, dx\). In the setting where we consider the integral of a velocity function \(v\), \(\int_a^b v(t) \,dt\) measures the exact change in position of the moving object on \([a,b]\); when \(v\) is nonnegative, \(\int_a^b v(t) \,dt\) is the object's distance traveled on \([a,b]\).%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-4495}{}%
The definite integral is a sophisticated sum, and thus has some of the same natural properties that finite sums have. Perhaps most important of these is how the definite integral respects sums and constant multiples of functions, which can be summarized by the rule%
\begin{equation*}
\int_a^b [c f(x) \pm k g(x)] \,dx = c \int_a^b f(x) \,dx \pm k \int_a^b g(x) \,dx
\end{equation*}
where \(f\) and \(g\) are continuous functions on \([a,b]\) and \(c\) and \(k\) are arbitrary constants.%

\item\hypertarget{li-2913}{}\hypertarget{p-4510}{}%
Since the area between the velocity function and the \(t\)-axis tells us distance traveled (provided we are careful about velocity being negative), we can use definite integrals to express the total change in position.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4511}{}%
The change in position on \([0,0.5]\) is \(\int_0^{0.5} v(t) dt\), and the value of this integral is positive since velocity is positive. The change in position on \([0.5,3.5]\) is \(\int_{0.5}^{3.5} v(t) dt\), and the value of this integral is negative since the velocity is negative. Finally, the change in position on \([3.5,4]\) is \(\int_{3.5}^4 v(t) dt\), which is positive. Thus, the total change in position, \(P\), is%
\begin{equation*}
P = \int_0^{0.5} v(t) dt + \int_{0.5}^{3.5} v(t) dt + \int_{3.5}^{4} v(t) dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
By the additive property of definite integrals, the total change in position is%
\begin{equation*}
P = \int_0^{4} v(t) dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-2914}{}\hypertarget{p-4512}{}%
We can evaluate the three integrals identified in (a) by finding the areas of relevant triangles since the velocity function is piecewise linear. In particular,%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^{0.5} v(t) dt = \frac{1}{2}(0.5)(1) = 0.25\text{,}
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
\int_{0.5}^{3.5} v(t) dt = -\frac{1}{2}(3)(2) = -3\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and%
\begin{equation*}
\int_{3.5}^{4} v(t) dt = \frac{1}{2}(0.5)(0.5) = 0.125\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Thus, the total change in position is%
\begin{align*}
P &= \int_{0}^4 v(t) dt\\
&= \int_0^{0.5} v(t) dt + \int_{0.5}^{3.5} v(t) dt + \int_{3.5}^{4} v(t) dt\\
&= 0.25 - 3 + 0.125\\
&= -2.625
\end{align*}
feet.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2915}{}\hypertarget{p-4513}{}%
For the total distance traveled, \(D\), we take the opposite of the change in position on any interval where the velocity is negative. Hence,%
\begin{align*}
D &= \int_0^{0.5} v(t) dt - \int_{0.5}^{3.5} v(t) dt + \int_{3.5}^{4} v(t) dt\\
&= 0.25 + 3 + 0.125\\

\begin{equation*}
f_{\operatorname{AVG} [a,b]} = \frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b f(x) dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
So the average velocity, \(AV\), of the object on the interval \([0,4]\) is%
\begin{equation*}
AV = \frac{1}{4} \int_0^4 v(t) \, dt = (0.25)(-2.625) = -0.65625

feet per second.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2917}{}\hypertarget{p-4515}{}%
Assuming that \(v\) is linear on the interval \([0,1.5]\), the slope of \(v\) is \(-\frac{3}{1.5} = -2\). Given that the \(v\)-intercept is \((0,1)\) we conclude that on the interval \([0,1.5]\) we have \(v(t) = -2t+1\). Now position, \(s\), is an antiderivative of the velocity, \(v\), so the possible formulas for \(s\) on the interval \([0,1.5]\) are \(s(t) = -t^2+t+C\), where \(C\) is some constant. If we want \(s(0) = 0\), that forces \(C=0\) and so the object's position function on \([0, 1.5]\) that satisfies \(s(0) = 0\) is \(s(t) = -t^2+t\).%

We observe that \(v(t) = 0\) at \(t = 0\), \(t = 1\), and \(t = 3\), and \(v(t)\) is positive on the intervals \(0 \lt t \lt 1\) and \(3 \lt t \lt 4\), while \(v(t)\) is negative on \(1 \lt t \lt 3\). The total change in position, \(P\), of the object is thus given by%
\begin{equation*}
P = \int_0^1 v(t) \, dt + \int_1^3 v(t) \, dt + \int_3^4 v(t) \, dt = \int_0^4 v(t) \, dt\text{.}

\item\hypertarget{li-2929}{}\hypertarget{p-4530}{}%
Using computational technology, we use the midpoint rule to estimate the total change of position, \(\int_0^4 v(t) \, dt\). We find that \(M_{25} = 2.6496\), \(M_{50} = 2.6624\), \(M_{75} = 2.66477\), and \(M_{100} = 2.6656\). Since it appears that neither of the first two decimal places are changing as we increase the number of subintervals, it looks like \(P = \int_0^4 v(t) \, dt \approx 2.665\) is accurate to two decimal places.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2930}{}\hypertarget{p-4531}{}%
We noted in (a) where \(v(t)\) is positive and negative. In particular, on \(1 \lt t \lt 3\), \(v(t) \lt 0\), and thus \(\int_1^3 v(t) \, dt\) will give us a negative change in position; the distance traveled on this interval is therefore \(-\int_1^3 v(t) \, dt\), and hence the total distance traveled, \(D\), on \([0,4]\) is%
\begin{equation*}
D = \int_0^1 v(t) \, dt - \int_1^3 v(t) \, dt + \int_3^4 v(t) \, dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-2931}{}\hypertarget{p-4532}{}%
To use Riemann sums to estimate \(D\), we have to estimate each of the three integrals individually. We find that %
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-4533}{}%
\(\int_0^1 v(t) \, dt \approx M_{100} = 0.41669\),%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-4534}{}%
\(\int_1^3 v(t) \, dt \approx M_{100} = -2.6668\), and%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-4535}{}%
\(\int_1^4 v(t) \, dt \approx M_{100} = 4.91667\)%
\end{itemize}
 From experimenting with different \(n\)-values in \(M_n\), it is apparent that each of these individual estimates is accurate to at least \(3\) decimal places, and thus we expect their sum to be accurate to at least \(2\). Hence,%
\begin{equation*}
D = \int_0^1 v(t) \, dt - \int_1^3 v(t) \, dt + \int_3^4 v(t) \, dt \approx 0.41669 - (-2.6668) + 4.91667 = 8.00016\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Therefore \(D \approx 8.00016\) is an estimate of distance traveled accurate to at least \(2\) decimal places.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2935}{}\hypertarget{p-4536}{}%
We know that the average velocity on \([0,4]\) is given by the integral expression%
\begin{equation*}
v_{\operatorname{AVG} [0,4]} = \frac{1}{4-0} \int_0^4 v(t) \, dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
We estimated the definite integral in (b), so using that result,%
\begin{equation*}
v_{\operatorname{AVG} [0,4]} \approx \frac{1}{4-0} 2.665 = 0.66625
\end{equation*}
feet per second is the object's average velocity, accurate to at least two decimal places. It makes sense that the average velocity is positive since the total change in position is positive.%

Now \(\int_0^1 f(x) \, dx\) is the area of a triangle of height \(2\) and base \(1\), so \(\int_0^1 f(x) \, dx = 1\). Also, \(\int_0^1 g(x) \,dx\) is the opposite of the area of a quarter circle of radius \(1\), so \(\int_0^1 g(x) \,dx = \frac{\pi}{4}\). Therefore,%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^1 [f(x) + g(x)] \,dx = \int_0^1 f(x) \,dx + \int_0^1 g(x) \,dx = 1-\frac{\pi}{4}\text{.}
\end{equation*}

The value of \(\int_1^4 f(x) \,dx\) is the difference of the areas of the regions \(f\) bounds above the \(x\)-axis minus the areas of the regions \(f\) bounds below the \(x\)-axis on the interval \([1,4]\). The area of the triangle \(f\) bounds above the \(x\)-axis on the interval \([1,1.5]\) is \((0.5)(2)(0.5) = 0.5\), the area of the region \(f\) bounds below the \(x\)-axis on \([1.5,2]\) is also \(0.5\), the area of the region \(f\) bounds below the \(x\)-axis on \([2,3]\) is the area (\(2\)) of a rectangle with height \(2\) and base \(1\), and the area of the region \(f\) bounds below the \(x\)-axis on \([3,4]\) is the area (\(1\)) of a triangle with height \(2\) and base \(1\). So%
\begin{equation*}
\int_1^4 f(x) \,dx = 0.5-0.5-2-1 = -3\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Notice that the graph of \(g\) is linear on the interval \([1,2]\), passing through the points \((1,-1)\) and \((2,2)\). This line has slope \(3\) and equation \(y = -1+3(x-1)\). The \(x\)-intercept of this line is \(\frac{4}{3}\). So the triangle the graph of \(g\) bounds on the interval \(\left[1, \frac{4}{3}\right]\) has area \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)(1) = \frac{1}{6}\), and the area of the triangle between the graph of \(g\) and the \(x\)-axis on the interval \(\left[\frac{4}{3}, 2\right]\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)(2) = \frac{2}{3}\). Finally, the graph of \(g\) bounds a quarter circle of radius \(2\) on the interval \([2,4]\), so%
\begin{equation*}
\int_1^4 g(x) \,dx = -\frac{1}{6} + \frac{2}{3} + \pi = \frac{1}{2} + \pi\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Therefore,%
\begin{equation*}
\int_1^4 [2f(x) - 3g(x)] \, dx = 2\int_1^4 f(x) \, dx - 3\int_1^4 g(x) \, dx = (2)(-3) - (3)\left(\frac{1}{2} + \pi\right) = -\frac{15}{2} - 3\pi\text{.}
\end{equation*}

\item\hypertarget{li-2946}{}\hypertarget{p-4551}{}%
Recall that the average value of a function \(f\) on an interval \([a,b]\) is%
\begin{equation*}
f_{\operatorname{AVG} [a,b]} = \frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b f(x) \,dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Combining the results from (a) and (b) gives us%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^4 f(x) \,dx = \int_0^1 f(x) \,dx +\int_1^4 f(x) \,dx = 1 -3 = -2
\end{equation*}
and%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^4 g(x) \,dx = \int_0^1 g(x) \,dx +\int_1^4 g(x) \,dx = -\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{1}{2} + \pi =  \frac{1}{2} + \frac{3\pi}{4}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Thus, the average value of \(h\) on the interval \([0,4]\) is%
\begin{align*}
h_{\operatorname{AVG} [0,4]} &= \frac{1}{4} \int_0^4 [g(x)-f(x)] \,dx\\
&= \frac{1}{4} \left(\int_0^4 g(x) \,dx - \int_0^4 f(x) \,dx \right)\\
&= \frac{1}{4} \left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{3\pi}{4} - (-2) \right)\\
&= \frac{5}{8} + \frac{3\pi}{16}\text{.}

We know that \(\int_0^4 c \, dx\) is the signed area of a rectangle with ``height" \(c\) (note that \(c\) could be negative), and base \(4\), so%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^4 c \, dx = 4c\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Also, from part (c) we have%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^4 [f(x) + g(x)] \, dx = \int_0^4 f(x) \, dx + \int_0^4 g(x) \, dx = -2+\frac{1}{2} + \frac{3\pi}{4} = -\frac{3}{2} + \frac{3\pi}{4}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Therefore,%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^4 c \, dx = \int_0^4 [f(x) + g(x)] \, dx
\end{equation*}
from which it follows that \(4c = -\frac{3}{2} + \frac{3\pi}{4}\) so \(c = -\frac{3}{8} + \frac{3\pi}{16}\).%

From the above two figures, we see that the exact area between the two curves is the area under \(f\) (\(A_1\)) minus the area under \(g\) (\(A_2\)). That is,%

because we can find the area as the difference of the area under \(p\) (\(\int_a^b p(x) \, dx\)) and the area under \(q\) (\(\int_a^b q(x) \, dx\)), and then subtract the two definite integrals as shown in (d).%

%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-4571}{}%
How can we find the exact value of a definite integral without taking the limit of a Riemann sum?%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-4572}{}%
What is the statement of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, and how do antiderivatives of functions play a key role in applying the theorem?%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-4573}{}%
What is the meaning of the definite integral of a rate of change in contexts other than when the rate of change represents velocity?%
\end{itemize}
\end{objectives}
\hypertarget{p-4574}{}%
Much of our work in \hyperref[C-4]{Chapter~\ref{C-4}} has been motivated by the velocity-distance problem: if we know the instantaneous velocity function, \(v(t)\), for a moving object on a given time interval \([a,b]\), can we determine the distance it traveled on \([a,b]\)? If the velocity function is nonnegative on \([a,b]\), the area bounded by \(y = v(t)\) and the \(t\)-axis on \([a,b]\) is equal to the distance traveled. This area is also the value of the definite integral \(\int_a^b v(t) \, dt\). If the velocity is sometimes negative, the total area bounded by the velocity function still tells us distance traveled, while the net signed area tells us the object's change in position.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4575}{}%
For instance, for the velocity function in \hyperref[F-4-4-Intro]{Figure~\ref{F-4-4-Intro}}, the total distance \(D\) traveled by the moving object on \([a,b]\) is%
\begin{equation*}
D = A_1 + A_2 + A_3\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and the total change in the object's position is%
\begin{equation*}
s(b) - s(a) = A_1 - A_2 + A_3\text{.}
\end{equation*}
The areas \(A_1\), \(A_2\), and \(A_3\) are each given by definite integrals, which may be computed by limits of Riemann sums (and in special circumstances by geometric formulas).%

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-2981}{}\hypertarget{p-4597}{}%
Starting with the velocity function given, \(v(t)=-32t+16\), we want to think about what function could give us \(v(t)\) as its derivative. Using the power rule, we know that \(\frac{d}{dt}t^k=kt^{k-1}\). In this case, we are starting with some \(at^{k-1}\), so we must add 1 to the exponent and divide by that new exponent to \emph{undo} the differentiation. So, we get that \(s(t)=\frac{-32t^2}{2}+\frac{16t}{1}\). However, adding a constant to \(s(t)\) keeps the derivative \(v(t)\) (remember that constants have derivative 0). So, we have most generally that \(s(t)=-16t^2+16t+c\), where \(c\) is some constant.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4598}{}%
Now we want to find \(c\) given the condition that \(s(0)=32\). So,%
\begin{equation*}
32=s(0)=-16(0)^2+16(0)+c.
\end{equation*}
Therefore, \(c=32\). Then \(s(t)=-16t^2+16t+32\)%
\item\hypertarget{li-2982}{}\hypertarget{p-4599}{}%
Recall that we have a critical point where the derivative of a function is 0, which will result in a maximum point. Since the position function is a quadratic function, this will tell us the time that the water balloon reaches its maximum height. So, let's set the derivative equal to 0:%
\begin{equation*}
-32t+16=0,
\end{equation*}
so \(t=0.5\). Therefore, after 0.5 seconds the water balloon reaches its maximum height.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4600}{}%
To find the time it takes for the water balloon to land we set the position function equal to 0:%
\begin{equation*}
-16t^2+16t+32=0
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
-16(t-2)(t+1)=0
\end{equation*}
Thus, it takes 2 seconds for the water balloon to hit the groups.%
\item\hypertarget{li-2983}{}\hypertarget{p-4601}{}%
We just need to plug the values into the position function: \(s(\frac{1}{2}) - s(0)=36-32=4\), \(s(2) - s(\frac{1}{2})=0-36=-36\), and \(s(2) - s(0)=0-32=-32\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-2984}{}\hypertarget{p-4602}{}%
We know from part (c) that the total vertical distance from time 0 to the maximum height is 4 feet. Again, from part (c), we know that from the maximum height to when the water balloon hits the ground is a vertical distance of 36 feet. The total vertical distance traveled by the water balloon is 40 feet.%

We can calculate the area under the curve by breaking this into two triangles. The first triangle has height 16 and width 0.5, so the area is \(16\cdot 0.5\cdot 0.5=4\). The second triangle has a negative height of -48 and width of 1.5, so the area is \(-48\cdot 1.5\cdot 0.5=-36\). Notice that we want to keep the area under the \(x\)-axis negative. Thus, the total net signed area is -32.%

Suppose we know the position function \(s(t)\) and the velocity function \(v(t)\) of an object moving in a straight line, and for the moment let us assume that \(v(t)\) is positive on \([a,b]\). Then, as shown in \hyperref[F-4-4-FTCVel]{Figure~\ref{F-4-4-FTCVel}}, we know two different ways to compute the distance, \(D\), the object travels: one is that \(D = s(b) - s(a)\), the object's change in position. The other is the area under the velocity curve, which is given by the definite integral, so \(D = \int_a^b v(t) \, dt\).%
\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=0.47\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/4_4_FTCVel.pdf}
\caption{Finding distance traveled when we know a velocity function \(v\).\label{F-4-4-FTCVel}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-4606}{}%
Since both of these expressions tell us the distance traveled, it follows that they are equal, so%
\begin{equation}
s(b) - s(a) = \int_a^b v(t) \, dt\text{.}\label{E-FTCVel}
\end{equation}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4607}{}%
\hyperref[E-FTCVel]{Equation~(\ref{E-FTCVel})} holds even when velocity is sometimes negative, because \(s(b) - s(a)\),the object's change in position, is also measured by the net signed area on \([a,b]\) which is given by \(\int_a^b v(t) \, dt\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4608}{}%
Perhaps the most powerful fact \hyperref[E-FTCVel]{Equation~(\ref{E-FTCVel})} reveals is that we can compute the integral's value if we can find a formula for \(s\). Remember, \(s\) and \(v\) are related by the fact that \(v\) is the derivative of \(s\), or equivalently that \(s\) is an antiderivative of \(v\).%
\begin{example}[]\label{Ex-FTCVel}
\hypertarget{p-4609}{}%
Determine the exact distance traveled on \([1,5]\) by an object with velocity function \(v(t) = 3t^2 + 40\) feet per second. The distance traveled on the interval \([1,5]\) is given by%
\begin{equation*}
D  =  \int_1^5 v(t) \,dt  =  \int_1^5 (3t^2 + 40) \, dt  =   s(5) - s(1)\text{,}
\end{equation*}
where \(s\) is an antiderivative of \(v\). Now, the derivative of \(t^3\) is \(3t^2\) and the derivative of \(40t\) is \(40\), so it follows that \(s(t) = t^3 + 40t\) is an antiderivative of \(v\). Therefore,%
\begin{align*}
D &= \int_1^5 3t^2 + 40 \, dt  = s(5) - s(1)\\
&=  (5^3 + 40 \cdot 5) - (1^3 + 40\cdot 1) = 284 \ \text{feet}\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-4610}{}%
Note the key lesson of \hyperref[Ex-FTCVel]{Example~\ref{Ex-FTCVel}}: to find the distance traveled, we need to compute the area under a curve, which is given by the definite integral. But to evaluate the integral, we can find an antiderivative, \(s\), of the velocity function, and then compute the total change in \(s\) on the interval. In particular, we can evaluate the integral without computing the limit of a Riemann sum.%
\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-4611}{}%
Mathematicians find it convenient to have a shorthand symbol for a function's antiderivative and so we introduce the following notation. For a continuous function \(f\), we often denote an antiderivative of \(f\) by \(F\). That is, \(F'(x) = f(x)\) for all relevant \(x\). Using a similar notation \(V\) in place of \(s\) (so that \(V\) is an antiderivative of \(v\), that is \(V'(x)=v(x)\)) in Equation~\hyperref[E-FTCVel]{(\ref{E-FTCVel})}, we can write%
\begin{equation}
V(b) - V(a) = \int_a^b v(t) \, dt\text{.}\label{E-FTCV}
\end{equation}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4612}{}%
Now, to evaluate the definite integral \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\) for an arbitrary continuous function \(f\), we could certainly think of \(f\) as representing the velocity of some moving object, and \(x\) as the variable that represents time. But \hyperref[E-FTCVel]{Equations~(\ref{E-FTCVel})} and~\hyperref[E-FTCV]{(\ref{E-FTCV})} hold for any continuous velocity function, even when \(v\) is sometimes negative. So \hyperref[E-FTCV]{Equation~(\ref{E-FTCV})} offers a shortcut route to evaluating any definite integral, provided that we can find an antiderivative of the integrand. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) \index{FTC} summarizes these observations.%
\begin{assemblage}[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]\label{FTC}
\hypertarget{p-4613}{}%
\index{fundamental theorem of calculus} If \(f'(x)\) is a continuous function on \([a,b]\), and \(f\) is any antiderivative of \(f'(x)\), then \(\int_a^b f'(x) \, dx = f(b) - f(a)\).%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-4614}{}%
It is important to note that there is an alternative way of writing the fundamental theorem that is employed in many texts and examples using our convenient notation.%
\begin{assemblage}[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]\label{FTC_2}
\hypertarget{p-4615}{}%
If \(f(x)\) is a continuous function on \([a,b]\), and \(F\) is any antiderivative of \(f(x)\), then \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)\).%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-4616}{}%
These two statements of the fundamental theorem are equivalent.  Specifically, many authors choose to denote a function by \(f\) and the antiderivative of that function by \(F\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4617}{}%
A common alternate notation for \(F(b) - F(a)\) is%
\begin{equation*}
F(b) - F(a) = \left.
F(x) \right|_a^b\text{,}
\end{equation*}
where we read the righthand side as ``the function \(F\) evaluated from \(a\) to \(b\).'' In this notation, the FTC says that%
\begin{equation*}
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = \left.
F(x) \right|_a^b\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4618}{}%
The FTC opens the door to evaluating a wide range of integrals if we can find an antiderivative \(F\) for the integrand \(f\). For instance since \(\frac{d}{dx}[\frac{1}{3}x^3] = x^2\), the FTC tells us that%
\begin{align*}
\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx =\mathstrut \amp  \left. \frac{1}{3} \, x^3 \right|_0^1\\
=\mathstrut \amp  \frac{1}{3} \, (1)^3 - \frac{1}{3} \, (0)^3\\
=\mathstrut \amp  \frac{1}{3}\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4619}{}%
But finding an antiderivative can be far from simple; it is often difficult or even impossible. While we can differentiate just about any function, even some relatively simple functions don't have an elementary antiderivative. A significant portion of integral calculus (which is the main focus of second semester college calculus) is devoted to the problem of finding antiderivatives.%

Because \(\frac{d}{dx}[2x - x^2] = 2-2x\), by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,%
\begin{equation*}
\int_{-1}^4 (2-2x) \, dx = \left. 2x - x^2 \right|_{-1}^4\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and therefore%
\begin{equation*}
\int_{-1}^4 (2-2x) \, dx = (2 \cdot 4 - 4^2) - (2(-1) - (-1)^2) = -8 + 3 = -5\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-3002}{}\hypertarget{p-4640}{}%
Since \(\frac{d}{dx} [\cos(x)] = -\sin(x)\), an antiderivative of \(f(x) = \sin(x)\) is \(F(x) = -\cos(x)\). Therefore, by the FTC,%
\begin{equation*}
\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \sin(x) \, dx = \left. -\cos(x) \right|_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
so%

Since \(e^x\) is its own derivative, it is also its own antiderivative. Hence,%

\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-3004}{}\hypertarget{p-4642}{}%
Note that since \(\frac{d}{dx} [x^6] = 6x^5\), it follows that \(\frac{d}{dx} [\frac{1}{6}x^6] = x^5\), and thus%
\begin{equation*}
\int_{-1}^{1} x^5 \, dx = \left. \frac{1}{6}x^6 \right|_{-1}^1 = \frac{1}{6} (1)^6 - \frac{1}{6}(-1)^6 = 0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-3005}{}\hypertarget{p-4643}{}%
Using the sum and constant multiple rules for differentiation, we can see that similar results hold for antidifferentiation, and thus that \(F(x) = \frac{3}{4} x^4 - \frac{2}{3} x^3 - e^x\) is an antiderivative of \(f(x) = 3x^3 - 2x^2 - e^x\). Now, by the FTC,%

\subsection[{The Total Change Theorem}]{The Total Change Theorem}\label{subsection-116}
\index{total change theorem}\hypertarget{p-4644}{}%
Let us review three interpretations of the definite integral. \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-4645}{}%
For a moving object with instantaneous velocity \(v(t)\), the object's change in position on the time interval \([a,b]\) is given by \(\int_a^b v(t) \, dt\), and whenever \(v(t) \ge 0\) on \([a,b]\), \(\int_a^b v(t) \, dt\) tells us the total distance traveled by the object on \([a,b]\).%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-4646}{}%
For any continuous function \(f\), its definite integral \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\) represents the net signed area bounded by \(y = f(x)\) and the \(x\)-axis on \([a,b]\), where regions that lie below the \(x\)-axis have a minus sign associated with their area.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-4647}{}%
The value of a definite integral is linked to the average value of a function: for a continuous function \(f\) on \([a,b]\), its average value \(f_{\operatorname{AVG} [a,b]}\) is given by%
\begin{equation*}
f_{\operatorname{AVG} [a,b]} = \frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b f(x) \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{itemize}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4648}{}%
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus now enables us to evaluate exactly (without taking a limit of Riemann sums) any definite integral for which we are able to find an antiderivative of the integrand.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4649}{}%
A slight change in perspective allows us to gain even more insight into the meaning of the definite integral. Recall \hyperref[E-FTCV]{Equation~(\ref{E-FTCV})}, where we wrote the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for a velocity function \(v\) with antiderivative \(V\) as%
\begin{equation*}
V(b) - V(a) = \int_a^b v(t) \, dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4650}{}%
If we instead replace \(V\) with \(s\) (which represents position) and replace \(v\) with \(s'\) (since velocity is the derivative of position), \hyperref[E-FTCV]{Equation~(\ref{E-FTCV})} then reads as%
\begin{equation}
s(b) - s(a) = \int_a^b s'(t) \, dt\text{.}\label{E-FTCs}
\end{equation}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4651}{}%
In words, this version of the FTC tells us that the total change in an object's position function on a particular interval is given by the definite integral of the position function's derivative over that interval.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4652}{}%
Of course, this result is not limited to only the setting of position and velocity. Writing the result in terms of a more general function \(f\), we have the Total Change Theorem.%
\begin{assemblage}[Total Change Theorem]\label{total-change-theorem}
\hypertarget{p-4653}{}%
\index{total change theorem} If \(f\) is a continuously differentiable function on \([a,b]\) with derivative \(f'\), then \(f(b) - f(a) = \int_a^b f'(x) \, dx\). That is, the definite integral of the rate of change of a function on \([a,b]\) is the total change of the function itself on \([a,b]\).%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-4654}{}%
The Total Change Theorem tells us more about the relationship between the graph of a function and that of its derivative. Recall that heights on the graph of the derivative function are equal to slopes on the graph of the function itself. If instead we know \(f'\) and are seeking information about \(f\), we can say the following:%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-2}{}
\hypertarget{p-4655}{}%
\emph{differences in heights on \(f\) correspond to net signed areas bounded by \(f'\).}%
\end{quote}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/4_4_TCT.pdf}
\caption{The graphs of \(f'(x) = 4 - 2x\) (at left) and an antiderivative \(f(x) = 4x - x^2\) at right.  Differences in heights on \(f\) correspond to net signed areas bounded by \(f'\).\label{F-4-4-TCT}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-4656}{}%
To see why this is so, consider the difference \(f(1) - f(0)\). This value is 3, because \(f(1) = 3\) and \(f(0) = 0\), but also because the net signed area bounded by \(y = f'(x)\) on \([0,1]\) is 3. That is,%
\begin{equation*}
f(1) - f(0) = \int_0^1 f'(x) \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4657}{}%
In addition to this observation about area, the Total Change Theorem enables us to answer questions about a function whose rate of change we know.%
\begin{example}[]\label{Ex-4-4-1}
\hypertarget{p-4658}{}%
Suppose that pollutants are leaking out of an underground storage tank at a rate of \(r(t)\) gallons/day, where \(t\) is measured in days. It is conjectured that \(r(t)\) is given by the formula \(r(t) = 0.0069t^3 -0.125t^2+11.079\) over a certain 12-day period. The graph of \(y=r(t)\) is given in \hyperref[F-4-4-TCTEx]{Figure~\ref{F-4-4-TCTEx}}. What is the meaning of \(\int_4^{10} r(t) \, dt\) and what is its value? What is the average rate at which pollutants are leaving the tank on the time interval \(4 \le t \le 10\)?%
\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-239}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-4659}{}%
Since \(r(t) \ge 0\), the value of \(\int_4^{10} r(t) \, dt\) is the area under the curve on the interval \([4,10]\). A Riemann sum for this area will have rectangles with heights measured in gallons per day and widths measured in days, so the area of each rectangle will have units of%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\text{gallons} }{\text{day} } \cdot \text{days}  = \text{gallons}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4660}{}%
Thus, the definite integral tells us the total number of gallons of pollutant that leak from the tank from day 4 to day 10. The Total Change Theorem tells us the same thing: if we let \(R(t)\) denote the total number of gallons of pollutant that have leaked from the tank up to day \(t\), then \(R'(t) = r(t)\), and%
\begin{equation*}
\int_4^{10} r(t) \, dt = R(10) - R(4)\text{,}
\end{equation*}
the number of gallons that have leaked from day 4 to day 10.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4661}{}%
To compute the exact value of the integral, we use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Antidifferentiating \(r(t) = 0.0069t^3 -0.125t^2+11.079\), we find that%
\begin{align*}
\int_4^{10} 0.0069t^3 -0.125t^2+11.079 \, dt =\mathstrut \amp  \left. 0.0069 \cdot \frac{1}{4} \, t^4 - 0.125 \cdot \frac{1}{3} t^3 + 11.079t \right|_4^{10}\\
\approx\mathstrut \amp  44.282\text{.}

%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4662}{}%
Thus, approximately 44.282 gallons of pollutant leaked over the six day time period.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4663}{}%
To find the average rate at which pollutant leaked from the tank over \(4 \le t \le 10\), we compute the average value of \(r\) on \([4,10]\). Thus,%
\begin{equation*}
r_{\operatorname{AVG} [4,10]} = \frac{1}{10-4} \int_4^{10} r(t) \, dt \approx \frac{44.282}{6} = 7.380

Since the units on a rectangle in a Riemann sum are cal/min for the height and min for the width, the units of the area of such a rectangle are calories, and hence the units of area under the curve \(y = c(t)\) are given in total calories. Hence, the total calories burned during the first 10 minutes of the workout is given by the definite integral \(\int_0^{10} c(t) \, dt\). We use the FTC and evaluate the integral, finding that%
\begin{align*}
\int_0^{10} (-0.05t^2 + t + 10) \, dt =\mathstrut \amp  \left. \left( -\frac{0.05}{3} t^3 + \frac{1}{2} t^2 + 10t \right) \right|_0^{10}\\
=\mathstrut \amp  \left( -\frac{0.05}{3} (10)^3 + \frac{1}{2} (10)^2 + 10(10) \right) - (0)\\
=\mathstrut \amp  \frac{400}{3} \ \text{calories}\text{.}
\end{align*}
Thus, the person burned approximately 133.33 calories in the first 10 minutes of the workout.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3022}{}\hypertarget{p-4682}{}%
We observe first that by the Total Change Theorem, \(C(40) - C(0) = \int_0^{40} C'(t) \, dt = \int_0^{40} c(t) \, dt\), and therefore, as discussed in (a), the meaning of this value is the total calories burned on \([0,40]\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-3023}{}\hypertarget{p-4683}{}%
The exact average rate at which the person burned calories on \(0 \le t \le 40\) is given by%
\begin{equation*}
c_{\text{AVG} [0,40]} = \frac{1}{40-0} \int_0^{40} c(t) \, dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
To calculate \(\int_0^{40} c(t) \, dt\), we recognize that \(c(t)\) is defined in piecewise fashion, and use the additive property of the definite integral, which tells us that%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^{40} c(t) \, dt = \int_0^{10} c(t) \, dt +  \int_{10}^{30} c(t) \, dt +  \int_{30}^{40} c(t) \, dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
We know from our work in (a) that \(\int_0^{10} c(t) \, dt = \frac{400}{3}\). Since \(c(t) = 15\) is constant on \(10 \le t \le 20\), it follows that \(\int_{10}^{30} c(t) \, dt  = 15 \cdot 30 = 300\). And finally, it is straightforward to show using \(c(t) = -0.05t^2 + 3t - 30\) (or symmetry) on \(30 \le t \le 40\) that \(\int_{30}^{40} c(t) \, dt = \frac{400}{3}\). Hence,%
\begin{align*}
\int_0^{40} c(t) \, dt =\mathstrut \amp  \int_0^{10} c(t) \, dt +  \int_{10}^{30} c(t) \, dt +  \int_{30}^{40} c(t) \, dt\\
=\mathstrut \amp  \frac{400}{3} + 300 + \frac{400}{3}\\
=\mathstrut \amp  \frac{1700}{3} \approx 566.67 \ \text{calories}\text{.}
\end{align*}
Now, it follows that the exact average rate at which calories were burned on \([0,40]\) is%
\begin{equation*}
c_{\text{AVG} [0,40]} = \frac{1}{40-0} \int_0^{40} c(t) \, dt = \frac{1}{40} \cdot \frac{1700}{3} = \frac{1700}{120} \approx 14.17 \ \text{cal/min}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-3024}{}\hypertarget{p-4684}{}%
It makes sense intuitively that there must be at least one time at which the instantaneous rate at which calories are burned equals the average rate at which calories are burned, as it would be impossible for a continuous instantaneous rate of change to always be above its average value. Since we know from (c) that \(c_{\text{AVG} [0,40]} = \frac{85}{6}\), and \(c(t)\) tells us the instantaneous rate at which calories are burned, it follows that we want to solve the equation%
\begin{equation*}
c(t) = \frac{85}{6}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
From the graph, it appears that there are two such values of \(t\) for which this equation is true, one in the first ten minutes, and one in the last ten. For instance, solving%
\begin{equation*}
-0.05t^2 + t + 10 = \frac{85}{6}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
it follows that \(t = \frac{5}{3}(6 \pm \sqrt{6}) \approx 14.082, 5.918\), only the second of which lies in \(0 \le t \le 10\). So one time at which the instantaneous rate at which calories are burned equals the average rate on \([0,40]\) is \(t = \frac{5}{3}(6 - \sqrt{6}) \approx 5.918\). Similar reasoning leads to the second time that lies in \([30,40]\).%

\item{}\hypertarget{p-4686}{}%
We can find the exact value of a definite integral without taking the limit of a Riemann sum or using a familiar area formula by finding the antiderivative of the integrand, and hence applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-4687}{}%
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus says that if \(f\) is a continuous function on \([a,b]\) and \(F\) is an antiderivative of \(f\), then%
\begin{equation*}
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Hence, if we can find an antiderivative for the integrand \(f\), evaluating the definite integral comes from simply computing the change in \(F\) on \([a,b]\).%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-4688}{}%
A slightly different perspective on the FTC allows us to restate it as the Total Change Theorem, which says that%
\begin{equation*}
\int_a^b f'(x) \, dx = f(b) - f(a)\text{,}
\end{equation*}
for any continuously differentiable function \(f\). This means that the definite integral of the instantaneous rate of change of a function \(f\) on an interval \([a,b]\) is equal to the total change in the function \(f\) on \([a,b]\).%

Given an original function, we know that the units on its derivative are ``units of input per unit of output.'' Since the units on \(m(h)\) are ``minutes per foot'', it follows that the antiderivative of \(m(h)\) should have output units of ``minutes'' since its input units are ``feet''. The antiderivative function should thus tell us the total number of minutes that it takes for the plane to climb to an altitude of \(h\) feet.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3038}{}\hypertarget{p-4702}{}%
The number of minutes required for the airplane to ascend to \(10{,}000\) feet of altitude is given by the definite integral%
\begin{equation*}
M = \int_{0}^{10000} m(h) \, dh
\end{equation*}
since the units on \(m(h)\) are ``minutes per foot'' and the units on \(\triangle h\) in the corresponding Riemann sum are ``feet'', so when we take the product of quantities with these units, the resulting numerical quantity is measured in minutes.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3039}{}\hypertarget{p-4703}{}%
For the Riemann sum \(M_5\), we have \(5\) subintervals. Given the original data, this means that we need to evaluate the function at every other known data point. In particular,%
\begin{align*}
\int_{0}^{10000} m(h) \, dh &\approx M_5\\
&= m(1000) \cdot 2000 + m(3000) \cdot 2000 + m(5000) \cdot 2000\\
&+ m(7000) \cdot 2000 + m(9000) \cdot 2000\\
&= \left( \frac{1}{875} + \frac{1}{780} + \frac{1}{685} + \frac{1}{585} + \frac{1}{490} \right) \cdot 2000\\
&\approx 0.007634980475 \cdot 2000\\
&\approx 15.27\text{.}
\end{align*}
Thus, it takes the plane a bit more than \(15\) minutes to climb to an altitude of 10,000 feet.%

Yes, \(AV_{[a,b]} = \displaystyle v_{\operatorname{AVG} [a,b]}\). This is true because of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the definitions of these two quantities. In particular,%
\begin{align*}
\displaystyle v_{\operatorname{AVG} [a,b]} &= \frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b v(t) \, dt\\

Average velocity can be thought of in two very different ways: one as the change in position divided by change in time, the other as an average of the values of \(v(t)\) itself.%

Given the graph of a function's derivative, how can we construct a completely accurate graph of the original function?%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-4710}{}%

\item{}\hypertarget{p-4711}{}%
Given a function \(f\), how does the rule \(A(x) = \int_0^x f(t) \, dt\) define a new function \(A\)?%
\end{itemize}
\end{objectives}
\hypertarget{p-4712}{}%
A recurring theme in our discussion of differential calculus has been the question: ``given information about the derivative of an unknown function \(f\), how much information can we obtain about \(f\) itself?'' In \hyperref[act-1-8-2]{Example~\ref{act-1-8-2}}, the graph of \(y = f'(x)\) was known (along with the value of \(f\) at a single point) and we endeavored to sketch a possible graph of \(f\) near the known point. In \hyperref[Ex-f-from-f-prime]{Example~\ref{Ex-f-from-f-prime}}, \textemdash{} we investigated how the first derivative test enables us to use information about \(f'\) to determine where the original function \(f\) is increasing and decreasing, as well as where \(f\) has relative extreme values. If we know a formula or graph of \(f'\), we can find where the original function \(f\) is concave up and concave down by computing \(f''\). Thus, knowing \(f'\) and \(f''\) enables us to understand the shape of the graph of \(f\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4713}{}%
We returned to this question in even more detail in \hyperref[sec-4-1-velocity-distance]{Section~\ref{sec-4-1-velocity-distance}}. In that setting, we knew the instantaneous velocity of a moving object and worked to determine as much as possible about the object's position function. We found connections between the net signed area under the velocity function and the corresponding change in position of the function, and the Total Change Theorem further illuminated these connections between \(f'\) and \(f\), showing that the total change in the value of \(f\) over an interval \([a,b]\) is determined by the net signed area bounded by \(f'\) and the \(x\)-axis on the same interval.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4714}{}%
In what follows, we explore the situation where we possess an accurate graph of the derivative function along with a single value of the function \(f\). From that information, we'd like to determine a graph of \(f\) that shows where \(f\) is increasing, decreasing, concave up, and concave down, and also provides an accurate function value at any point.%
\begin{example}[]\label{PA-5-1}

Further, assume that \(f'\) is piecewise linear (as pictured) and that for \(x \le 0\) and \(x \ge 6\), \(f'(x) = 0\). Finally, it is given that \(f(0) = 1\).%

To find where the function is increasing, we want to look at where the derivative function is positive (i.e., where the derivative is above the \(x\)-axis). Therefore, \(f(x)\) is increasing on \((0,1.5)\cup(4,6)\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4741}{}%
To find where the function is decreasing, we want to look at where the derivative function is negative (i.e., where the derivative is below the \(x\)-axis). Therefore, \(f(x)\) is decreasing on \((1.5,4)\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-3061}{}\hypertarget{p-4742}{}%
To find where the function is concave up, we want to look at where the slope of the derivative is positive. Therefore, \(f(x)\) is concave up on \((0,1)\cup(3,5)\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4743}{}%
To find where the function is concave down, we want to look at where the slope of the derivative is negative. Therefore, \(f(x)\) is concave down on \((1,3)\cup (5,6)\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-3062}{}\hypertarget{p-4744}{}%
To find where the function has relative minima, we want to look at where the derivative is zero. In order for the values to be a minimum, we need them to occur after the function increases and then it changes to decreasing. Therefore, there are relative minima at \(x=1.5, 6\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4745}{}%
Similarly, to find relative maxima, we look where the derivative is zero, and after the function decreases and then changes to increasing. Therefore, there is a relative maximum at \(x=4\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-3063}{}\hypertarget{p-4746}{}%
The integral on the right side of the equation \(\int_0^1 f'(x) \, dx\) is the value of the area under the curve between 0 and 1. That area is given by \(1\cdot 1\cdot 0.5\). Therefore, \(\int_0^1 f'(x) \, dx=0.5\). Since \(f(0)=1\), we have \(f(1)-1=0.5\). Therefore, \(f(1)=1.5\)%
\item\hypertarget{li-3064}{}\hypertarget{p-4747}{}%
We follow a similar process to find the rest of the values: \(f(2)=1.5, f(3)=-0.5, f(4)=-2, f(5)=-0.5, f(6)=1.\)%

\hypertarget{p-4748}{}%
Note that in this case, it can be more accurate to solve for \(f(a)\) by solving the following equation in each case%

\hyperref[PA-5-1]{Example~\ref{PA-5-1}} demonstrates that when we can find the exact area under the graph of a function on any given interval, it is possible to construct a graph of the function's antiderivative. That is, we can find a function whose derivative is given. We can now determine not only the overall shape of the antiderivative graph, but also the actual \emph{height} of the graph at any point of interest.%

This is a consequence of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: if we know a function \(f\) and the value of the antiderivative \(F\) at some starting point \(a\), we can determine the value of \(F(b)\) via the definite integral. Since \(F(b) - F(a) = \int_a^b f(x) \, dx\), it follows that%

\subsection[{Multiple antiderivatives of a single function}]{Multiple antiderivatives of a single function}\label{subsection-119}
\hypertarget{p-4782}{}%
In the final question of \hyperref[act-5-1-1]{Example~\ref{act-5-1-1}}, we encountered a very important idea: a function \(f\) has more than one antiderivative. Each antiderivative of \(f\) is determined uniquely by its value at a single point. For example, suppose that \(f\) is the function given at left in \hyperref[F-5-1-Ex1]{Figure~\ref{F-5-1-Ex1}}, and suppose further that \(F\) is an antiderivative of \(f\) that satisfies \(F(0) = 1\).%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/5_1_Ex1.pdf}
\caption{At left, the graph of \(y = f(x)\).  At right, three different antiderivatives of \(f\).\label{F-5-1-Ex1}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-4783}{}%
Then, using \hyperref[E-FTCTCT]{Equation~(\ref{E-FTCTCT})}, we can compute%
\begin{align*}
F(1) &= F(0) + \int_0^1 f(x) \, dx\\
&= 1 + 0.5\\
&= 1.5\text{.}
\end{align*}
Similarly, \(F(2) = 1.5\), \(F(3) = -0.5\), \(F(4) = -2\), \(F(5) = -0.5\), and \(F(6) = 1\). In addition, we can use the fact that \(F' = f\) to ascertain where \(F\) is increasing and decreasing, concave up and concave down, and has relative extremes and inflection points. We ultimately find that the graph of \(F\) is the one given in blue in \hyperref[F-5-1-Ex1]{Figure~\ref{F-5-1-Ex1}}.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4784}{}%
If we want an antiderivative \(G\) for which \(G(0) = 3\), then \(G\) will have the exact same shape as \(F\) (since both share the derivative \(f\)), but \(G\) will be shifted vertically from the graph of \(F\), as pictured in red in \hyperref[F-5-1-Ex1]{Figure~\ref{F-5-1-Ex1}}. Note that \(G(1) - G(0) = \int_0^1 f(x) \, dx = 0.5\), just as \(F(1) - F(0) = 0.5\), but since \(G(0) = 3\), \(G(1) = G(0) + 0.5 = 3.5\), whereas \(F(1) = 1.5\). In the same way, if we assigned a different initial value to the antiderivative, say \(H(0) = -1\), we would get still another antiderivative, as shown in magenta in \hyperref[F-5-1-Ex1]{Figure~\ref{F-5-1-Ex1}}.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4785}{}%
This example demonstrates an important fact that holds more generally:%
\begin{assemblage}\label{assemblage-107}
\hypertarget{p-4786}{}%
If \(G\) and \(H\) are both antiderivatives of a function \(f\), then the function \(G - H\) must be constant.%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-4787}{}%
To see why this result holds, observe that if \(G\) and \(H\) are both antiderivatives of \(f\), then \(G' = f\) and \(H' = f\). Hence,%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx}[ G(x) - H(x) ] = G'(x) - H'(x) = f(x) - f(x) = 0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Since the only way a function can have derivative zero is by being a constant function, it follows that the function \(G - H\) must be constant.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4788}{}%
We now see that if a function has at least one antiderivative, it must have infinitely many: we can add any constant of our choice to the antiderivative and get another antiderivative. For this reason, we sometimes refer to the \emph{general antiderivative} \index{antiderivative!general} of a function \(f\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4789}{}%
To identify a particular antiderivative of \(f\), we must know a single value of the antiderivative \(F\) (this value is often called an \emph{initial condition}). \index{initial condition} For example, if \(f(x) = x^2\), its general antiderivative is \(F(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 + C\), where we include the ``\(+C\)'' to indicate that \(F\) includes \emph{all} of the possible antiderivatives of \(f\). If we know that \(F(2) = 3\), we substitute 2 for \(x\) in \(F(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 + C\), and find that%
\begin{equation*}
3 = \frac{1}{3}(2)^3 + C\text{,}
\end{equation*}
or \(C = 3 - \frac{8}{3} = \frac{1}{3}\). Therefore, the particular antiderivative in this case is \(F(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 + \frac{1}{3}\).%

\hypertarget{p-4804}{}%
Equation~\hyperref[E-FTCTCT]{(\ref{E-FTCTCT})} allows us to compute the value of the antiderivative \(F\) at a point \(b\), provided that we know \(F(a)\) and can evaluate the definite integral from \(a\) to \(b\) of \(f\). That is,%
\begin{equation*}
F(b) = F(a) + \int_a^b f(x) \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4805}{}%
In several situations, we have used this formula to compute \(F(b)\) for several different values of \(b\), and then plotted the points \((b,F(b))\) to help us draw an accurate graph of \(F\). This suggests that we may want to think of \(b\), the upper limit of integration, as a variable itself. To that end, we introduce the idea of an \emph{integral function}, \index{integral function} a function whose formula involves a definite integral.%
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{definition-2}
\hypertarget{p-4806}{}%
If \(f\) is a continuous function, we define the corresponding \terminology{integral function} \(A\) according to the rule%
\begin{equation}
A(x) = \int_a^x f(t) \, dt\text{.}\label{E-intfxn}
\end{equation}
%
\end{definition}
\hypertarget{p-4807}{}%
Note that because \(x\) is the independent variable in the function \(A\), and determines the endpoint of the interval of integration, we need to use a different variable as the variable of integration. A standard choice is \(t\), but any variable other than \(x\) is acceptable.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4808}{}%
One way to think of the function \(A\) is as the ``net signed area from \(a\) up to \(x\)'' function, where we consider the region bounded by \(y = f(t)\). For example, in \hyperref[F-5-1-IntFxn]{Figure~\ref{F-5-1-IntFxn}}, we see a function \(f\) pictured at left, and its corresponding area function (choosing \(a = 0\)), \(A(x) = \int_0^x f(t) \, dt\) shown at right.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/5_1_IntFxn.pdf}
\caption{At left, the graph of the given function \(f\).  At right, the area function \(A(x) = \int_0^x f(t) \  dt\).\label{F-5-1-IntFxn}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-4809}{}%
The function \(A\) measures the net signed area from \(t = 0\) to \(t = x\) bounded by the curve \(y = f(t)\); this value is then reported as the corresponding height on the graph of \(y = A(x)\). At \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/cz}{http://gvsu.edu/s/cz}, we find a java applet\footnote{David Austin, Grand Valley State University\label{fn-50}} that brings the static picture in \hyperref[F-5-1-IntFxn]{Figure~\ref{F-5-1-IntFxn}} to life. There, the user can move the red point on the function \(f\) and see how the corresponding height changes at the light blue point on the graph of \(A\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4810}{}%
The choice of \(a\) is somewhat arbitrary. In the example that follows, we explore how the value of \(a\) affects the graph of the integral function.%
\begin{example}[]\label{act-5-1-3}
\hypertarget{p-4811}{}%
Suppose that \(g\) is given by the graph at left in \hyperref[F-5-1-Act3]{Figure~\ref{F-5-1-Act3}} and that \(A\) is the corresponding integral function defined by \(A(x) = \int_1^x g(t) \, dt\).%

\(A\) is accumulating positive signed area wherever \(g\) is positive, and thus \(A\) is increasing on \((0,1.5)\), \((4,6)\); \(A\) is accumulating negative signed area and therefore decreasing wherever \(g\) is negative, which occurs on \((1.5,4)\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-3120}{}\hypertarget{p-4835}{}%
Here we want to consider where \(A\) is changing at an increasing rate (concave up) or changing at a decreasing rate (concave down). On \((0,1)\) and \((4,5)\), \(A\) is increasing, and we can also see that since \(g\) is increasing, \(A\) is increasing at an increasing rate. Similarly, on \((3,4)\) (where \(g\) is negative so \(A\) is decreasing), since \(g\) is increasing it follows that \(A\) is decreasing at an increasing rate. Thus, \(A\) is concave up on \((0,1)\) and \((3,5)\). Analogous reasoning shows that \(A\) is concave down on \((1,3)\) and \((5,6)\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-3121}{}\hypertarget{p-4836}{}%
Based on our work in (a), we see that \(A\) changes from increasing to decreasing at \(x = 1.5\), and thus \(A\) has a relative maximum there. Similarly, \(A\) has a relative minimum at \(x = 4\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-3122}{}\hypertarget{p-4837}{}%
Using the fact that \(g\) is piecewise linear and the definition of \(A\), we find that \(A(0) = \int_1^0 g(t) \, dt = -\int_0^1 g(t) \, dt = -\frac{1}{2}\); \(A(1) = \int_1^1 g(t) \, dt = 0\); \(A(2) = \int_1^2 g(t) \, dt = 0\). Analogous reasoning shows that \(A(3) = -2\), \(A(4) = -3.5\), \(A(5) = -2\), \(A(6) = -0.5\).%

Note that \(B(0) = 0\), while \(A(0) = -\frac{1}{2}\). Likewise, \(B(1) = \frac{1}{2}\), while \(A(1) = 0\). Indeed, we can see that for any value of \(x\), \(B(x) = A(x) + \frac{1}{2}\).%

Given the graph of a function \(f\), we can construct the graph of its antiderivative \(F\) provided that (a) we know a starting value of \(F\), say \(F(a)\), and (b) we can evaluate the integral \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\) exactly for relevant choices of \(a\) and \(b\). For instance, if we wish to know \(F(3)\), we can compute \(F(3) = F(a) + \int_a^3 f(x) \, dx\). When we combine this information about the function values of \(F\) together with our understanding of how the behavior of \(F' = f\) affects the overall shape of \(F\), we can develop a completely accurate graph of the antiderivative \(F\).%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-4842}{}%
Because the derivative of a constant is zero, if \(F\) is an antiderivative of \(f\), it follows that \(G(x) = F(x) + C\) will also be an antiderivative of \(f\). Moreover, any two antiderivatives of a function \(f\) differ precisely by a constant. Thus, any function with at least one antiderivative in fact has infinitely many, and the graphs of any two antiderivatives will differ only by a vertical translation.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-4843}{}%
Given a function \(f\), the rule \(A(x) = \int_a^x f(t) \, dt\) defines a new function \(A\) that measures the net-signed area bounded by \(f\) on the interval \([a,x]\). We call the function \(A\) the integral function corresponding to \(f\).%

An antiderivative function \(C\) measures the total number of calories burned in the workout since \(t = 0\). Since the units on \(c(t) = C'(t)\) are ``calories per minute'', the units on \(C(t)\) are ``calories''.%

The value of \(C(5) = C(0) + \int_0^5 c(t) \, dt\). Since \(c\) is piecewise constant, the value of the integral is simply the area of the rectangle bounded by \(c\), so \(C(5) = C(0) + (2.5)(5) = 0 + 12.5 = 12.5\). Reasoning similarly, %

We use the First Fundamental Theorem and areas under the curves to complete the desired table. As an example, first note that%
\begin{equation*}
B(0) =  \int_{0}^{0} f(t) \, dt = 0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Then, since the net-signed area between the graph of \(f\) and the \(x\)-axis on the interval \([-1,0]\) is the area of a square with side lengths of \(1\), we have%
\begin{equation*}
B(0) - B(-1) = \int_{-1}^0 f(t) \, dt
\end{equation*}
and thus \(B(0) - B(-1) = 1\), so \(0 - B(-1) = 1\) and \(B(-1) = -1\).%
\begin{align*}
B(1) &= B(0) + \int_0^1 f(t) \, dt = 0 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2},\\
B(2) &= B(1) + \int_1^2 f(t) \, dt = \frac{1}{2} + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = 0,\\
B(3) &= B(2) + \int_2^3 f(t) \, dt = 0 + (-1) = -1,\\
B(4) &= B(3) + \int_3^4 f(t) \, dt = -1 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\frac{3}{2},\\
B(5) &= B(4) + \int_4^5 f(t) \, dt = -\frac{3}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = -1,\\
B(6) &= B(5) + \int_5^6 f(t) \, dt = -1 + 1 = 0\text{.}
\end{align*}
We can also say that%
\begin{equation*}
A(x) = \int_{-1}^x f(t) \, dt = \int_{-1}^0 f(t) \, dt + \int_0^x f(t) \, dt = 1+B(x)
\end{equation*}
and%
\begin{equation*}
C(x) = \int_1^x f(t) \, dt = \int_{0}^x f(t) \, dt - \int_0^1 f(t) \, dt = B(x) - \frac{1}{2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}

\hypertarget{p-4903}{}%
The general problem of finding an antiderivative is difficult. In part, this is due to the fact that we are trying to undo the process of differentiating, and the undoing is much more difficult than the doing. For example, while it is evident that an antiderivative of \(f(x) = \sin(x)\) is \(F(x) = -\cos(x)\) and that an antiderivative of \(g(x) = x^2\) is \(G(x) = \frac{1}{3} x^3\), combinations of \(f\) and \(g\) can be far more complicated. Consider the functions%
\begin{equation*}
5\sin(x) - 4x^2, \ x^2 \sin(x), \ \frac{\sin(x)}{x^2}, \ \text{and}  \ \sin(x^2)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
In the above cases, the antiderivative might not be obvious and in some cases, for example, \(\sin(x^2)\) the antiderivative cannot be written down using elementary functions.  This warrants the question, how do we find an antiderivative from a function given by a formula in general?  We will begin to answer that question in this chapter.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsection 5.2.1 Basic antiderivatives}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[{Basic antiderivatives}]{Basic antiderivatives}\label{sec-4-4-ss2}
\hypertarget{p-4904}{}%
What is involved in trying to find an antiderivative for each? From our experience with derivative rules, we know that derivatives of sums and constant multiples of basic functions are simple to execute, but derivatives involving products, quotients, and composites of familiar functions are more complicated. Therefore, it stands to reason that antidifferentiating products, quotients, and composites of basic functions may be even more challenging. We defer our study of all but the most elementary antiderivatives to later in the text.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4905}{}%
Before proceeding any further it will be useful to state two properties. \begin{assemblage}[Properties of Antiderivatives: Sums and Constant Multiples]\label{assemblage-108}
\hypertarget{p-4906}{}%
Let \(f\) and \(g\) be functions that have an antiderivative and \(c\) a constant then%
\begin{align*}
\int\left(f(x) \pm g(x)\right) dx &=  \int f(x)dx \pm \int g(x)dx\\
\int cf(x) dx &=  c\int f(x)dx\text{.}
\end{align*}
In other words, the antiderivative of a sum is the sum of the antiderivatives.%
\end{assemblage}
 We forgo a formal proof of these properties but note that they are a consequence of the Constant Multiple Rule and Sum Rule for derivatives in \hyperref[sec-2-1-elem-rules]{Section~\ref{sec-2-1-elem-rules}}.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4907}{}%
We do note that whenever we know the derivative of a function, we have a \emph{function-derivative pair}, so we also know the antiderivative of a function. For instance, since we know that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx}[-\cos(x)] = \sin(x)\text{,}
\end{equation*}
we also know that \(F(x) = -\cos(x)\) is an antiderivative of \(f(x) = \sin(x)\). \(F\) and \(f\) together form a function-derivative pair. Clearly, every basic derivative rule leads us to such a pair, and thus to a known antiderivative.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4908}{}%
In \hyperref[act-4-4-2]{Example~\ref{act-4-4-2}}, we will construct a list of the basic antiderivatives we know at this time. Those rules will help us  antidifferentiate sums and constant multiples of basic functions. For example, since \(-\cos(x)\) is an antiderivative of \(\sin(x)\) and \(\frac{1}{3}x^3\) is an antiderivative of \(x^2\), it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
F(x) = -5\cos(x) - \frac{4}{3}x^3
\end{equation*}
is an antiderivative of \(f(x) = 5\sin(x) - 4x^2\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4909}{}%
Finally, before proceeding to build a list of common functions whose antiderivatives we know, we recall that each function has more than one antiderivative. Because the derivative of any constant is zero, we may add a constant of our choice to any antiderivative. For instance, we know that \(G(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3\) is an antiderivative of \(g(x) = x^2\). But we could also have chosen \(G(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 + 7\), since in this case as well, \(G'(x) = x^2\). If \(g(x) = x^2\), we say that the \emph{general antiderivative} \index{antiderivative!general} of \(g\) is%
\begin{equation*}
G(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 + C\text{,}
\end{equation*}
where \(C\) represents an arbitrary real number constant. Regardless of the formula for \(g\), including \(+C\) in the formula for its antiderivative \(G\) results in the most general possible antiderivative.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4910}{}%
In the following example, we work to build a list of basic functions whose antiderivatives we already know.%
\begin{example}[]\label{act-4-4-2}
\hypertarget{p-4911}{}%
Use your knowledge of derivatives of basic functions to complete the above table of antiderivatives. For each entry, your task is to find a function \(F\) whose derivative is the given function \(f\).%

\hypertarget{p-4912}{}%
The antiderivative of \(\frac{1}{x}\) is \(\ln|x|+C\). The absolute value sign comes about by considering two cases separately. For \(x>0\), we have that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx}\left(\ln(x)\right)=\frac{1}{x}

\hypertarget{p-4914}{}%
Now that we have some basic antiderivatives in hand we can proceed to solve problems involving the definite integral when the integrand is an expression.  Specifically, we seek to use antiderivatives and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate expressions like \(\displaystyle \int_0^1 \left(x^3 - x - e^x + 2\right) \,dx\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4915}{}%
Since our current interest in antiderivatives is so that we can evaluate definite integrals by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus the constant \(C\) is actually irrelevant, and mathematicians genrally omit it in these types of problems. To see why, consider the definite integral%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4916}{}%
For the integrand \(g(x) = x^2\), suppose we find and use the general antiderivative \(G(x) = \frac{1}{3} x^3 + C\). Then, by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,%
\begin{align*}
\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx &=  \left. \frac{1}{3} x^3 + C \right|_0^1\\
&= \left(\frac{1}{3} (1)^3 + C  \right) - \left(\frac{1}{3} (0)^3 + C  \right)\\
&= \frac{1}{3} + C - 0 - C\\
&= \frac{1}{3}\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4917}{}%
Observe that the \(C\)-values appear as opposites in the evaluation of the integral and thus do not affect the definite integral's value.%

\subsection[{Integration and the Area between Two Curves}]{Integration and the Area between Two Curves}\label{subsection-124}
\hypertarget{p-4932}{}%
Integration allows us to find the area between a curve and the \(x\)-axis.  In fact, by visually inspecting the graphs of two different curves we can develop a technique for finding the area between two curves.  Consider the graphs of the curves \(y=x^2+1\) and \(y=x+3\) displayed in \hyperref[F-5-2-SS4]{Figure~\ref{F-5-2-SS4}}.  We might ask if there is a way to find the area enclosed by these two curves as is colored in the figure.%
\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-4933}{}%
In fact, using the knowledge we have about integration, we can figure out this quantity exactly.%

\(\frac{9}{2}\)%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-252}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-4937}{}%
The first step in solving this problem is to determine where the curves intersect.  We can find the point of intersection by setting the two curves equal to each other.%
\begin{align*}
x^2+1 \amp=x+3\\
x^2-x-2 \amp=x+3\\
x^2-x-2 \amp=0\\
(x+1)(x-2) \amp=0
\end{align*}
Therefore, the curves intersect at two \(x\)-values, \(x=-1,2\).  This means were are concerned with the interval \([-2,2]\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4938}{}%
We next note that on the interval in question, \([-2,2]\), the curve \(g(x)=x+3\) is above the curve \(f(x)=x^2+1\).  We also note that \(\int_{-1}^{2}(x+3)dx\) would give the area shown in \hyperref[F-5-2-SS5]{Figure~\ref{F-5-2-SS5}} and \(\int_{-1}^{2}(x^2+1)dx\) \hyperref[F-5-2-SS6]{Figure~\ref{F-5-2-SS6}}.%

\caption{Graph of the curve \(y=x+3\).\label{F-5-2-SS6}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-4939}{}%
By overlaying \hyperref[F-5-2-SS5]{Figure~\ref{F-5-2-SS5}} and \hyperref[F-5-2-SS6]{Figure~\ref{F-5-2-SS6}} as in \hyperref[F-5-2-SS7]{Figure~\ref{F-5-2-SS7}} you can see that \hyperref[F-5-2-SS4]{Figure~\ref{F-5-2-SS4}} should be given by subtracting \(\int_{-1}^{2}(x^2+1)dx\) from \(\int_{-1}^{2}(x+3)dx\). \begin{figure}

%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4940}{}%
Therefore, the area between the curves \(y=x^2+1\) and \(y=x+3\) is given by the following quantity:%
\begin{align*}
\int_{-1}^{2}(x+3)dx-\int_{-1}^{2}(x^2+1)dx=\int_{-1}^{2}\left((x+3)-(x^2+1)\right)dx\\

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-3199}{}\hypertarget{p-4953}{}%
Since velocity is positive, distance traveled is the definite integral of velocity. Thus, on \([0,4]\), the total distance, \(D\), is%
\begin{equation*}
D = \int_0^4 v(t) \, dt = \int_0^4 \left( -\frac{1}{4}t^3 + \frac{3}{2}t^2 + 1 \right) \, dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,%
\begin{align*}
\int_0^4 \left( -\frac{1}{4}t^3 + \frac{3}{2}t^2 + 1 \right) \, dt &= \left. \left( -\frac{1}{16}t^4 + \frac{1}{2}t^3 + t \right) \right|_{t=0}^{t=4}\\
&= -\frac{1}{16}4^4 + \frac{1}{2}4^3 + 4\\
&= 20\text{,}
\end{align*}
so the distance traveled by the object on \([0,4]\) is \(20\) meters.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3200}{}\hypertarget{p-4954}{}%
To find the average velocity of the object on \([12,24]\), we first evaluate \(\int_{12}^{24} v(t) \, dt\). To do so, we use the fact that \(v\) is piecewise linear and employ standard geometric formulas to determine the value of the integral. The area of the trapezoid formed by \(v(t)\) and the vertical line segments at \(t = 12\) and \(t = 16\) is%
\begin{equation*}
A_1 = \frac{1}{2}(f(12) + f(16))(4) = 2(9 + 15) = 48\text{.}
\end{equation*}
The area of the rectangle formed by \(v(t)\) and the vertical line segments at \(t = 16\) and \(t = 20\) is%
\begin{equation*}
A_2 = 4 \cdot 15 = 60\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Finally, the area of the trapezoid formed by \(v(t)\) and the vertical line segments at \(t = 20\) and \(t = 24\) is%
\begin{equation*}
A_3 = \frac{1}{2}(f(20) + f(24))(4) = 2(15 + 6) = 42\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Thus,%
\begin{equation*}
\int_{12}^{24} v(t) \, dt = A_1 + A_2 + A_3 = 48 + 60 + 42 = 150\text{,}
\end{equation*}
from which it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
\displaystyle v_{\operatorname{AVG} [12,24]}  = \frac{1}{24-12} \int_{12}^{24} v(t) \, dt = \frac{150}{12} = 12.5
\end{equation*}
meters per minute.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3201}{}\hypertarget{p-4955}{}%
To find where \(a(t)\) is greatest, we recall that \(a(t) = v'(t)\), so we are seeking the location where the slope of the tangent line to \(v(t)\) is maximized on the interval \([0,24]\). From the graph, there are only two possible intervals where this can occur: \(0 \lt t \lt 4\) and \(12 \lt t \lt 16\), as these are both where \(v\) is increasing and thus \(a(t) = v'(t)\) is positive.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4956}{}%
On \(12 \lt t \lt 16\), \(a(t) = v'(t) = \frac{3}{2}\) since this is the slope of the line that forms \(v(t)\) on this interval. On \(0 \lt t \lt 4\), \(v(t) = -\frac{1}{4}t^3 + \frac{3}{2}t^2 + 1\), so \(a(t) = v'(t) = -\frac{3}{4}t^2 + 3t\). We see that \(a(t)\) is a quadratic function that opens down, so its maximum occurs at its vertex, which is located where \(a'(t) = 0\). We know that \(a'(t) = -\frac{3}{2}t + 3\), and \(0 = -\frac{3}{2}t + 3\) implies \(t = 2\). Moreover, \(a(2) = v'(2) = -\frac{3}{4} \cdot 2^2 + 3(2) = 3\). Clearly \(a(2) = 3 \gt \frac{3}{2}\), so the object's maximum acceleration is \(3\) meters per minute per minute at the instant \(t = 2\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-3202}{}\hypertarget{p-4957}{}%
Let \(V(t) = v(t) + c\) be the new velocity function that is the original velocity \(v\) increased by \(c\) at every time. We want to know the value of \(c\) for which total distance traveled is \(210\) meters. For this to be true, we must have that%
\begin{equation*}
210 = \int_{0}^{24} V(t) \, dt = \int_{0}^{24} \left( v(t) + c \right) \, dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Using the additive property of the definite integral and our earlier work in (b), we can say that%
\begin{equation*}
210 = \int_{0}^{24} v(t) \, dt + \int_{0}^{24} c \, dt = 150 + \int_{0}^{24} c \, dt\text{,}
\end{equation*}
so%
\begin{equation*}
\int_{0}^{24} c \, dt = 60\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Since the function \(f(t) = c\) is constant, the integral \(\int_{0}^{24} c \, dt\) represents the area of a rectangle \(24\) units wide and \(c\) units tall, so  \(\int_{0}^{24} c \, dt = 24c\). Hence,%
\begin{equation*}
24c = 60
\end{equation*}
so \(c = \frac{60}{24} = 2.5\).%

The net signed area enclosed by \(f\) and the \(x\)-axis on the interval \([2,5]\) is \(\int_2^5 f(x) \, dx\). The figure below shows a graph of \(f\) on the interval \([0,5]\). To calculate the definite integral of \(f\) on the interval \([2,5]\), we consider the integrals on the subintervals \([2,3]\) and \([3,5]\). Doing so and using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,%
\begin{align*}
\int_2^5 f(x) \, dx &= \int_2^3 f(x) \, dx + \int_3^5 f(x) \, dx\\
&= \int_2^3 -x+3 \, dx + \int_3^5 x^2-8x+15 \, dx\\
&= \left. \left( -\frac{1}{2}x^2 + 3x \right)\right|_2^3 + \left. \left( \frac{1}{3}x^3 - 4x^2 + 15x  \right)\right|_3^5\\

To find the average value of \(f\) on \([0,5]\) we need to first calculate%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^5 f(x) \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Using our work in (a) and considering the subintervals \([0,2]\) and \([2,5]\),%
\begin{align*}
\int_0^5 f(x) \, dx &= \int_0^2 f(x) \, dx + \int_2^5 f(x) \, dx\\
&= \int_0^2 -x^2 + 2x + 1 \, dx - \frac{5}{6}\\
&= \left. \left( -\frac{1}{3}x^3 + x^2 + x \right)\right|_0^2 - \frac{5}{6}\\
&= \frac{10}{3} - \frac{5}{6}\\
&= \frac{5}{2}\text{.}
\end{align*}
Therefore, the average value of \(f\) on \([0,5]\) is%
\begin{equation*}
\displaystyle f_{\operatorname{AVG} [0,5]} = \frac{1}{5-0} \int_0^5 f(x) \, dx = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right) \left(\frac{5}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-3211}{}\hypertarget{p-4969}{}%
Since \(\int_0^5 f(x) \, dx = \frac{5}{2}\), we need a function \(g\) that matches \(f\) but that is also defined on \([5,7]\) so that \(\int_5^7 g(x) \, dx = -\frac{5}{2}\). To preserve continuity, we will choose a formula for \(g\) that also satisfies \(g(5) = 0\). It's natural to pick a linear function whose graph encloses \(5/2\) units of area, so one that has a slope of \(5/4\). To check, we compute%
\begin{align*}
\int_5^7 -\frac{5}{4}(x - 5) \, dx &= -\left(\frac{5}{4}\right) \left. \left(\frac{x^2}{2} - 5x\right) \right|_5^7\\
&= -\left(\frac{5}{4}\right) \left( \frac{49-25}{2} - 5(7-5) \right)\\
&= -\left(\frac{5}{4}\right) \left( 12 - 10 \right)\\
&= -\left(\frac{5}{4}\right) \left( 2 \right) = -\frac{5}{2}\text{.}
\end{align*}
So \(g\) defined so that \(g(x) = f(x)\) for \(0 \le x \lt 5\) and \(g(x) = -\frac{5}{4}(x - 5)\) on \(5 \le x \le 7\) has the desired property. A graph of \(g\) is shown in the figure below.%

\hypertarget{p-4973}{}%
In previous chapters, we have seen that a function's derivative tells us the rate at which the function is changing. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus helped us determine the total change of a function over an interval from the function's rate of change. For instance, an object's velocity tells us the rate of change of that object's position. By integrating the velocity over a time interval, we can determine how much the position changes over that time interval. If we know where the object is at the beginning of that interval, we have enough information to predict where it will be at the end of the interval.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4974}{}%
In this chapter, we introduce the concept of \emph{differential equations}. A differential equation is an equation that provides a description of a function's derivative, which means that it tells us the function's rate of change. Using this information, we would like to learn as much as possible about the function itself. Ideally we would like to have an algebraic description of the function. Unfortunately, this is too much to ask in some situations, but you are still be able to make accurate approximations.  However, for this chapter we will stick to cases in which we can find an explicit solution to a differential equation.%

\subsection[{What is a differential equation?}]{What is a differential equation?}\label{subsection-125}
\index{differential equation}\hypertarget{p-4975}{}%
A differential equation is an equation that describes the derivative, or derivatives, of a function that is unknown to us. For instance, the equation%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x\sin(x^2)
\end{equation*}
describes the derivative of a function \(y(x)\) that is unknown to us.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4976}{}%
Many important examples of differential equations involve quantities that change in time; the independent variable in our discussion will frequently be time \(t\). For example, the differential equation%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{ds}{dt} = 4t + 1
\end{equation*}
describes an objects position (given by \(s(t)\)) as a function of time.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4977}{}%
If we know the velocity and the starting position of a moving object, we will be able to find its position at any later time.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4978}{}%
Because differential equations describe the derivative of a function, they give us information about how that function changes. Our goal will be to use this information to predict the value of the function in the future; in this way, differential equations are a type of "crystal ball."%
\begin{example}[]\label{PA-7-1}
\hypertarget{p-4979}{}%
The position of a moving object is given by the function \(s(t)\), where \(s\) is measured in feet and \(t\) in seconds. Assume that the object has velocity given by \(v(t) = 4t + 1\) feet per second. \leavevmode%

\(s(2)=17\).%

\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-3223}{}\hypertarget{p-4990}{}%
We can find the total change in the position of the object by integrating the equation for velocity over the interval \([0,4]\).  That is%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^4 (4t+1)dt=\left.(2t^2+t)\right\vert_0^4=36\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Therefore, the position changes by 36 feet over the interval \([0,4]\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-3224}{}\hypertarget{p-4991}{}%
Simply knowing how much the position has changed on the interval \([0,4]\) does not tell us where the object is.  In order to know where the object is located we must also know where the object started.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3225}{}\hypertarget{p-4992}{}%
We can find the total change in the position of the object by integrating the equation for velocity over the interval \([0,2]\).  That is%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^2 (4t+1)dt=\left.(2t^2+t)\right\vert_0^2=10\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Therefore, the position changes by 10 feet over the interval \([0,2]\).  Since we know that \(s(0)=7\), we can say that \(s(2)=7+10=17\) ft.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3226}{}\hypertarget{p-4993}{}%
Note that%
\begin{equation*}
\int (4t+1)dt=2t^2+t+C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Since \(s(0) = 7\) ft, it is reasonable to use \(s(0)\) to "find" the constant \(C\).  That is, we can say that \(7=2(0)^2+0+C\) which means \(C=7\).  Therefore, the position of the object at anytime is given by the equation \(s(t)=2t^2+t+7\).%

\index{differential equation!solution}\hypertarget{p-4994}{}%
A differential equation describes the derivative, or derivatives, of a function that is unknown to us. By a \emph{solution} to a differential equation, we simply mean a function that satisfies this description.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4995}{}%
For instance, the first differential equation we looked at is%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{ds}{dt} = 4t+1\text{,}
\end{equation*}
which describes an unknown function \(s(t)\). We may check that \(s(t) =
2t^2+t\) is a solution because it satisfies this description. Notice that \(s(t) = 2t^2+t+4\) is also a solution.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4996}{}%
If we have a candidate for a solution, it is straightforward to check whether it is a solution or not. Before we demonstrate, let's consider the same issue in a simpler context. Suppose we are given the equation \(2x^2 - 2x = 2x+6\) and asked whether \(x=3\) is a solution. To answer this question, we could rewrite the variable \(x\) in the equation with the symbol \(\Box\):%
\begin{equation*}
2\Box^2 - 2\Box = 2\Box + 6\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4997}{}%
To determine whether \(x=3\) is a solution, we can investigate the value of each side of the equation separately when the value \(3\) is placed in \(\Box\) and see if indeed the two resulting values are equal. Doing so, we observe that%
\begin{equation*}
2\Box^2 - 2\Box = 2\cdot3^2 - 2\cdot3 = 12\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and%
\begin{equation*}
2\Box + 6 = 2\cdot3 + 6 = 12\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4998}{}%
Therefore, \(x=3\) is indeed a solution.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-4999}{}%
We will do the same thing with differential equations. Consider the differential equation%
\begin{align*}
\frac{dv}{dt} =\mathstrut \amp  1.5 - 0.5v, \ \text{or}\\
\frac{d\Box}{dt} =\mathstrut \amp  1.5 - 0.5\Box\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5000}{}%
Let's ask whether \(v(t) = 3 - 2e^{-0.5t}\) is a solution\footnote{At this time, don't worry about why we chose this function.\label{fn-51}}. Using this formula for \(v\), observe first that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dv}{dt} =  \frac{d\Box}{dt}  = \frac{d}{dt}[3 - 2e^{-0.5t}] = -2e^{-0.5t} \cdot (-0.5) = e^{-0.5t}
\end{equation*}
and%
\begin{equation*}
1.5 - 0.5v = 1.5 - 0.5\Box= 1.5 - 0.5(3 - 2e^{-0.5t}) = 1.5 - 1.5 + e^{-0.5t} = e^{-0.5t}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5001}{}%
Since \(\frac{dv}{dt}\) and \(1.5 - 0.5v\) agree for all values of \(t\) when \(v = 3-2e^{-0.5t}\), we have indeed found a solution to the differential equation.%
\begin{example}[]\label{act-7-1-3}

\frac{dv}{dt} = 1.5 - 0.5v\text{.}

Since \(v(t) = 1.5t - 0.25t^2\), \(\frac{dv}{dt} = 1.5 - 0.5t\). We observe that for this choice of \(v\), \(1.5 - 0.5v = 1.5 - 0.5(1.5t - 0.25t^2) = 1.5 - 0.75t + 0.125t^2 \ne 1.5 - 0.5t = \frac{dv}{dt}\), and thus \(v(t) = 1.5t - 0.25t^2\) is not a solution to the given differential equation.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3237}{}\hypertarget{p-5017}{}%
Since \(v(t) = 3 + 2e^{-0.5t}\), \(\frac{dv}{dt} = 2e^{-0.5t}(-0.5) = -e^{-0.5t}\). Hence, for this choice of \(v\), \(1.5 - 0.5v = 1.5 - 0.5(3+2e^{-0.5t}) = 1.5 - 1.5 - e^{-0.5t} = -e^{-0.5t} = \frac{dv}{dt}\). Therefore \(v(t) = 3 + 2e^{-0.5t}\) is a solution to the given differential equation.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3238}{}\hypertarget{p-5018}{}%
Since \(v(t) = 3\), \(\frac{dv}{dt} = 0\). Hence, for this choice of \(v\), \(1.5 - 0.5v = 1.5 - 0.5(3) = 1.5 - 1.5 = 0 = \frac{dv}{dt}\). Therefore \(v(t) = 3\) is a solution to the given differential equation.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3239}{}\hypertarget{p-5019}{}%
Since \(v(t) = 3 + Ce^{-0.5t}\) (where \(C\) is a constant), \(\frac{dv}{dt} = Ce^{-0.5t}(-0.5) = -0.5C e^{-0.5t}\). Hence, for this choice of \(v\), \(1.5 - 0.5v = 1.5 - 0.5(3+Ce^{-0.5t}) = 1.5 - 1.5 - 0.5Ce^{-0.5t} = -0.5Ce^{-0.5t} = \frac{dv}{dt}\). Therefore \(v(t) = 3 + Ce^{-0.5t}\) is a solution to the given differential equation for any choice of \(C\).%
\end{enumerate}
%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-5020}{}%
This example shows us something interesting. Notice that the differential equation has infinitely many solutions, which are parametrized by the constant \(C\) in \(v(t) = 3+Ce^{-0.5t}\). In \hyperref[F-7-1-family]{Figure~\ref{F-7-1-family}}, we see the graphs of these solutions for a few values of \(C\), as labeled.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.47\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/7_1_family.pdf}
\caption{The family of solutions to the differential equation \(\frac{dv}{dt} = 1.5 - 0.5v\).\label{F-7-1-family}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-5021}{}%
Notice that the value of \(C\) is connected to the initial value of the velocity \(v(0)\), since \(v(0) = 3+C\). In other words, while the differential equation describes how the velocity changes as a function of the velocity itself, this is not enough information to determine the velocity uniquely: we also need to know the initial velocity. For this reason, differential equations will typically have infinitely many solutions, one corresponding to each initial value. We have seen this phenomenon before: given the velocity of a moving object \(v(t)\), we cannot uniquely determine the object's position function unless we also know its initial position.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5022}{}%
If we are given a differential equation and an initial value for the unknown function, we say that we have an \emph{initial value problem.} For instance,%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dv}{dt} = 1.5-0.5v, \ v(0) = 0.5
\end{equation*}
is an initial value problem. In this problem, we know the value of \(v\) at one time and we know how \(v\) is changing. Consequently, there should be exactly one function \(v\) that satisfies the initial value problem.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5023}{}%
This demonstrates the following important general property of initial value problems.%
\begin{assemblage}\label{assemblage-109}
\hypertarget{p-5024}{}%

\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-5030}{}%
How does the integral function \(A(x) = \int_1^x f(t) \, dt\) define an antiderivative of \(f\)?%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-5031}{}%
What is the statement of the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus?%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-5032}{}%
How do the First and Second Fundamental Theorems of Calculus enable us to formally see how differentiation and integration are almost inverse processes?%
\end{itemize}
\end{objectives}
\hypertarget{p-5033}{}%
In \hyperref[sec-4-4-FTC]{Section~\ref{sec-4-4-FTC}}, we learned the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC), which from here forward will be referred to as the \emph{First} Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, \index{Fundamental Theorem of Calculus!First} as in this section we develop a corresponding result that follows it. Recall that the First FTC tells us that if \(f\) is a continuous function on \([a,b]\) and \(F\) is any antiderivative of \(f\) (that is, \(F' = f\)), then%
\begin{equation*}
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5034}{}%
We have used this result in two settings: \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*]
\item\hypertarget{li-3246}{}\hypertarget{p-5035}{}%
If we have a graph of \(f\) and we can compute the exact area bounded by \(f\) on an interval \([a,b]\), we can compute the change in an antiderivative \(F\) over the interval.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3247}{}\hypertarget{p-5036}{}%
If we can find an algebraic formula for an antiderivative of \(f\), we can evaluate the integral to find the net signed area bounded by the function on the interval.%
\end{enumerate}
 For the former, see \hyperref[PA-5-1]{Example~\ref{PA-5-1}} or \hyperref[act-5-1-1]{Example~\ref{act-5-1-1}}. For the latter, we can easily evaluate definite integrals such as%
\begin{equation*}
\int_1^4 x^2 \, dx\text{,}
\end{equation*}
since we know that the function \(F(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3\) is an antiderivative of \(f(x) = x^2\). Thus,%
\begin{align*}
\int_1^4 x^2 \, dx &= \frac{1}{3}x^3 \bigg\vert_1^4\\
&=  \frac{1}{3}(4)^3 - \frac{1}{3}(1)^3\\
&=  21\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5037}{}%
Thus, the First FTC can used in two ways. First, to find the difference \(F(b) - F(a)\) for an antiderivative \(F\) of the integrand \(f\), even if we may not have a formula for \(F\) itself. To do this, we must know the value of the integral \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\) exactly, perhaps through known geometric formulas for area. In addition, the First FTC provides a way to find the exact value of a definite integral, and hence a certain net signed area exactly, by finding an antiderivative of the integrand and evaluating its total change over the interval. In this case, we need to know a formula for the antiderivative \(F\). Both of these perspectives are reflected in \hyperref[F-5-2-Intro]{Figure~\ref{F-5-2-Intro}}.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/5_2_Intro.pdf}
\caption{At left, the graph of \(f(x) = x^2\) on the interval \([1,4]\) and the area it bounds.  At right, the antiderivative function \(F(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3\), whose total change on \([1,4]\) is the value of the definite integral at left.\label{F-5-2-Intro}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-5038}{}%
The value of a definite integral may have additional meaning depending on context: as the change in position when the integrand is a velocity function, the total amount of pollutant leaked from a tank when the integrand is the rate at which pollution is leaking, or other total changes if the integrand is a rate function. Also, the value of the definite integral is connected to the average value of a continuous function on a given interval: \(f_{\operatorname{AVG} [a,b]} = \frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b f(x) \, dx\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5039}{}%
In the last part of \hyperref[sec-5-1-antid-graphs]{Section~\ref{sec-5-1-antid-graphs}}, we studied integral functions of the form \(A(x) = \int_c^x f(t) \, dt\). \hyperref[F-5-1-IntFxn]{Figure~\ref{F-5-1-IntFxn}} is a particularly important image to keep in mind as we work with integral functions, and the corresponding java applet at \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/cz}{gvsu.edu/s/cz} can help us understand the function \(A\). In what follows, we use the First FTC to gain additional understanding of the function \(A(x) = \int_c^x f(t) \, dt\), where the integrand \(f\) is given (either through a graph or a formula), and \(c\) is a constant.%

\index{Fundamental Theorem of Calculus!Second}\hypertarget{p-5064}{}%
The result of \hyperref[PA-5-2]{Example~\ref{PA-5-2}} is not particular to the function \(f(t) = 4-2t\), nor to the choice of ``\(1\)'' as the lower bound in the integral that defines the function \(A\). For instance, if we let \(f(t) = \cos(t) - t\) and set \(A(x) = \int_2^x f(t) \, dt\), we can determine a formula for \(A\) by the First FTC. Specifically,%
\begin{align*}
A(x) &=  \int_2^x (\cos(t) - t) \, dt\\
&=  \sin(t) - \frac{1}{2}t^2 \bigg\vert_2^x\\
&=  \sin(x) -  \frac{1}{2}x^2 - \left(\sin(2) - 2 \right)\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5065}{}%
Differentiating \(A(x)\), since \(\sin(2) - 2\) is a constant, it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
A'(x) = \cos(x) - x\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and thus we see that \(A'(x) = f(x)\); so \(A\) is an antiderivative of \(f\). Also, since \(A(2) = \int_2^2 f(t) \, dt = 0\), \(A\) is the only antiderivative of \(f\) for which \(A(2) = 0\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5066}{}%
In general, if \(f\) is any continuous function, and we define the function \(A\) by the rule%
\begin{equation*}
A(x) = \int_c^x f(t) \, dt\text{,}
\end{equation*}
where \(c\) is an arbitrary constant, then we can show that \(A\) is an antiderivative of \(f\). To see why, let's demonstrate that \(A'(x) = f(x)\) by using the limit definition of the derivative. Doing so, we observe that%
\begin{align}
A'(x) \amp = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{A(x+h) - A(x)}{h}\notag\\
\amp = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\int_c^{x+h} f(t) \, dt - \int_c^x f(t) \, dt}{h}\notag\\
\amp = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\int_x^{x+h} f(t) \, dt}{h}\text{,}\label{E-FTC2limdef}
\end{align}
where \hyperref[E-FTC2limdef]{Equation~(\ref{E-FTC2limdef})} follows from the fact that \(\int_c^x f(t) \,dt + \int_x^{x+h} f(t) \, dt = \int_c^{x+h} f(t) \, dt\). Now, observe that for small values of \(h\),%
\begin{equation*}
\int_x^{x+h} f(t) \, dt \approx f(x) \cdot h\text{,}
\end{equation*}
by a simple left-hand approximation of the integral. Thus, as we take the limit in \hyperref[E-FTC2limdef]{Equation~(\ref{E-FTC2limdef})}, it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
A'(x) =  \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\int_x^{x+h} f(t) \, dt}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x) \cdot h}{h} = f(x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5067}{}%
Hence, \(A\) is indeed an antiderivative of \(f\). In addition, \(A(c) = \int_c^c f(t) \, dt = 0\). The preceding argument demonstrates the truth of the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which we state as follows.%
\begin{assemblage}[The Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]\label{FTC-2}
\hypertarget{p-5068}{}%
\index{second fundamental theorem of calculus} If \(f\) is a continuous function and \(c\) is any constant, then \(f\) has a unique antiderivative \(A\) that satisfies \(A(c) = 0\), and that antiderivative is given by the rule \(A(x) = \int_c^x f(t) \, dt\).%
\end{assemblage}

Our earlier work with \(F\) showed that \(F\) is an antiderivative of \(F\) that satisfied \(F(0) = -1\). Since \(F\) and \(A\) are both antiderivatives of \(f\), they differ by a constant, and that constant is \(-1 - (-\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\pi}{4}) = \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{1}{2}\).%

The Second FTC tells us that \(B' = f\) and \(C' = f\). Thus, \(B\) and \(C\) are each antiderivatives of \(f\), have the same shape as \(A\) and \(F\), and each differ from \(A\) by just a constant. Observing that \(B(3) = 0\) and \(C(1) = 0\) enables us to easily sketch these shifted versions of \(A\).%

\hypertarget{p-5094}{}%
The Second FTC provides us with a way to construct an antiderivative of any continuous function. In particular, if we are given a continuous function \(g\) and wish to find an antiderivative of \(G\), we can now say that%
\begin{equation*}
G(x) = \int_c^x g(t) \, dt
\end{equation*}
provides the rule for such an antiderivative, and moreover that \(G(c) = 0\). Note especially that we know that \(G'(x) = g(x)\), or%
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dx} \left[ \int_c^x g(t) \, dt \right] = g(x)\text{.}\label{E_diffint}
\end{equation}
%
\par

This result is useful for understanding the graph of \(G\).%

\(E\) is closely related to the well known \emph{error function} \index{error functin}\footnote{The error function is defined by the rule \(\erf (x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_0^x e^{-t^2} \,dt\) and has the key property that \(0 \le \erf (x) \lt 1\) for all \(x \ge 0\) and moreover that \(\lim_{x \to \infty} \erf (x) = 1\).\label{fn-52}} in probability and statistics. It turns out that the function \(e^{-t^2}\) does not have an elementary antiderivative.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5098}{}%
While we cannot evaluate \(E\) exactly for any value other than \(x = 0\), we still can gain a tremendous amount of information about the function \(E\). By applying the rule in \hyperref[E_diffint]{Equation~(\ref{E_diffint})} to \(E\), it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
E'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left[ \int_0^x e^{-t^2} \, dt \right] = e^{-x^2}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
so we know a formula for the derivative of \(E\), and we know that \(E(0) = 0\). This information is precisely the type we were given in \hyperref[act-3-1-1]{Example~\ref{act-3-1-1}}, where we were given information about the derivative of a function, but lacked a formula for the function itself.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5099}{}%
Using the first and second derivatives of \(E\), along with the fact that \(E(0) = 0\), we can determine more information about the behavior of \(E\). First, we note that for all real numbers \(x\), \(e^{-x^2} \gt 0\), and thus \(E'(x) \gt 0\) for all \(x\). Thus \(E\) is an always increasing function. Further, as \(x \to \infty\), \(E'(x) = e^{-x^2} \to 0\), so the slope of the function \(E\) tends to zero as \(x \to \infty\) (and similarly as \(x \to -\infty\)). Indeed, it turns out that \(E\) has horizontal asymptotes as \(x\) increases or decreases without bound.%

In addition, we can observe that \(E''(x) = -2xe^{-x^2}\), and that \(E''(0) = 0\), while \(E''(x) \lt 0\) for \(x \gt 0\) and \(E''(x) \gt 0\) for \(x \lt 0\). This information tells us that \(E\) is concave up for \(x\lt 0\) and concave down for \(x \gt 0\) with a point of inflection at \(x = 0\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5101}{}%
The only thing we lack at this point is a sense of how big \(E\) can get as \(x\) increases. If we use a midpoint Riemann sum with 10 subintervals to estimate \(E(2)\), we see that \(E(2) \approx 0.8822\); a similar calculation to estimate \(E(3)\) shows little change (\(E(3) \approx 0.8862\)), so it appears that as \(x\) increases without bound, \(E\) approaches a value just larger than \(0.886\), which aligns with the fact that \(E\) has horizontal asymptotes. Putting all of this information together (and using the symmetry of \(f(t) = e^{-t^2}\)), we see the results shown in \hyperref[F-5-2-erf]{Figure~\ref{F-5-2-erf}}.%

Because \(E\) is the antiderivative of \(f(t) = e^{-t^2}\) that satisfies \(E(0) = 0\), values on the graph of \(y = E(x)\) represent the net signed area of the region bounded by \(f(t) = e^{-t^2}\) from 0 up to \(x\). We see that the value of \(E\) increases rapidly near zero but then levels off as \(x\) increases, since there is less and less additional accumulated area bounded by \(f(t) = e^{-t^2}\) as \(x\) increases.%

\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[{Differentiating an Integral Function}]{Differentiating an Integral Function}\label{subsection-130}
\hypertarget{p-5132}{}%
We have seen that the Second FTC enables us to construct an antiderivative \(F\) for any continuous function \(f\) as the integral function \(F(x) = \int_c^x f(t) \, dt\). If we have a function of the form \(F(x) = \int_c^x f(t) \, dt\), then we know that \(F'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left[\int_c^x f(t) \, dt \right] = f(x)\). This shows that integral functions, while perhaps having the most complicated formulas of any functions we have encountered, are nonetheless particularly simple to differentiate. For instance, if%
\begin{equation*}
F(x) = \int_{\pi}^x \sin(t^2) \, dt\text{,}
\end{equation*}
then by the Second FTC, we know immediately that%
\begin{equation*}
F'(x) = \sin(x^2)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5133}{}%
In general, we know by the Second FTC that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx} \left[ \int_a^x f(t) \, dt \right] = f(x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5134}{}%
This equation says that ``the derivative of the integral function whose integrand is \(f\), is \(f\).'' We see that if we first integrate the function \(f\) from \(t = a\) to \(t = x\), and then differentiate with respect to \(x\), these two processes ``undo'' each other.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5135}{}%
What happens if we differentiate a function \(f(t)\) and then integrate the result from \(t = a\) to \(t = x\)? That is, what can we say about the quantity%
\begin{equation*}
\int_a^x \frac{d}{dt} \left[ f(t) \right] \, dt?
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5136}{}%
We note that \(f(t)\) is an antiderivative of \(\frac{d}{dt} \left[ f(t) \right]\) and apply the First FTC. We see that%
\begin{align*}
\int_a^x \frac{d}{dt} \left[ f(t) \right] \, dt &=  f(t) \bigg\vert_a^x\\
&=  f(x) - f(a)\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5137}{}%
Thus, we see that if we first differentiate \(f\) and then integrate the result from \(a\) to \(x\), we return to the function \(f\), minus the constant value \(f(a)\). So the two processes almost undo each other, up to the constant \(f(a)\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5138}{}%
The observations made in the preceding two paragraphs demonstrate that differentiating and integrating (where we integrate from a constant up to a variable) are almost inverse processes. This should not be surprising; integrating involves antidifferentiating, which reverses the process of differentiating. On the other hand, we see that there is some subtlety involved, because integrating the derivative of a function does not quite produce the function itself. This is because every function has an entire family of antiderivatives, and any two of those antiderivatives differ only by a constant.%

By the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we know that \(F'(x) = g(x)\). Thus, from the given graph of \(g\), it follows that \(F\) is increasing wherever \(g\) is positive (on the intervals \(x \lt -1\), \(0.5 \lt x \lt 4\), and \(5 \lt x \lt 6.5\)) and decreasing wherever \(g\) is negative (on \(-1 \lt x \lt 0.5\) and \(4 \lt x \lt 5\)). Furthermore, \(F\) is concave up wherever \(g\) is increasing (on approximately \(-0.4 \lt x \lt 2\) and \(4.5 \lt x \lt 6\)) and concave down werever \(g\) is decreasing (on approximately \(2 \lt x \lt 4.5\) and \(x \gt 6\)).%

In addition, from the given data about definite integrals and properties of the definite integral, we can determine the following function values:%

F(4) &= \int_{2}^{4} g(t) \, dt = \int_{0.5}^4 g(t) \, dt - \int_{0.5}^2 g(t) \, dt = 12.75 - 6.06 = 6.69\\
F(5) &= F(4) + \int_4^5 g(t) \,dt = 6.69 - 0.36 = 6.33\\

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-3339}{}\hypertarget{p-5182}{}%
Since the tide removes sand at a rate of \(R(t) = 2 + 5\sin \left( \frac{4\pi t}{25} \right)\) cubic yards of sand per hour, on the time interval \([0,6]\), it follows that since the units on \(R(t) \cdot \triangle t\) are ``cubic yards'', the total sand removed on this time interval is%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^6 \left[2 + 5\sin \left( \frac{4\pi t}{25} \right) \right] \, dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-3340}{}\hypertarget{p-5183}{}%
Because sand is being both removed and added, we can determine the total amount of sand on the beach at a given time \(t\) by integrating the difference between the the rates at which sand is being added and removed. In particular, since the total change is the integral of the rate of change, we have that the total amount of sand on the beach at time \(x\) is given by%
\begin{equation*}
Y(x) = \int_0^x \left[ S(t) - R(t) \right] \, dt = \int_0^x \left[ \frac{15t}{1+3t} - \left( 2 + 5\sin \left( \frac{4\pi t}{25} \right) \right) \right] \, dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-3341}{}\hypertarget{p-5184}{}%
We know that \(Y(x)\) measures the total amount of sand on the beach at time \(x\). Thus, the instantaneous rate at which the total number of cubic yards of sand on the beach is changing at time \(t=4\) is given by \(Y'(4)\). We first compute \(Y'(x)\). By the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we have%
\begin{equation*}
Y'(x) = S(x) - R(x)\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and thus \(Y'(4) = S(4) - R(4) \approx -1.90875\) cubic yards per hour.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3342}{}\hypertarget{p-5185}{}%
To find where the total sand function \(Y(x)\) has its minimum value on \([0,6]\), we look at the behavior of \(Y'(x) = S(x) - R(x)\). Plotting \(Y'(x)\) on the interval, we see that \(Y'(x) = 0\) at \(x \approx 5.118\), and for \(0 \le x \lt 5.118\), \(Y'(x) \lt 0\), and for \(5.118 \lt x \le 6\), \(Y'(x) \gt 0\). Thus, \(Y\) changes from decreasing to increasing at \(x \approx 5.118\) and has an absolute minimum there on the interval \([0,6]\). Furthermore, \(Y(5.118) \approx 2492.368\).%

Given an original function, we know that the units on its derivative are ``units of input per unit of output.'' Since the units on \(m(h)\) are ``minutes per foot'', it follows that the antiderivative of \(m(h)\) should have output units of ``minutes'' since its input units are ``feet''. The antiderivative function should thus tell us the total number of minutes that it takes for the plane to climb to an altitude of \(h\) feet.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3350}{}\hypertarget{p-5197}{}%
The number of minutes required for the airplane to ascend to \(10{,}000\) feet of altitude is given by the definite integral%
\begin{equation*}
M = \int_{0}^{10000} m(h) \, dh
\end{equation*}
since the units on \(m(h)\) are ``minutes per foot'' and the units on \(\triangle h\) in the corresponding Riemann sum are ``feet'', so when we take the product of quantities with these units, the resulting numerical quantity is measured in minutes.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3351}{}\hypertarget{p-5198}{}%
Reasoning similarly to our work in (c), the number of minutes required for the airplane to ascend to \(h\) feet of altitude is given by the definite integral%
\begin{equation*}
M(h) = \int_{0}^{t} m(t) \, dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Note that because \(h\) is the upper limit of integration, we need to use a different variable (\(t\)) of integration.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3352}{}\hypertarget{p-5199}{}%
The best possible estimates are provided by using the midpoint rule (we will learn why in Chapter 6, but the can also be determined by using left and right rules and thinking about the error for an always decreasing function like \(m(h)\)).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5200}{}%
On the interval \([0,6000]\), if we evaluate the function at every other data point, we can estimate the desired integral using \(3\) subintervals and find that%
\begin{align*}
\int_{0}^{6000} m(h) \, dh &\approx M_3\\
&= m(1000) \cdot 2000 + m(3000) \cdot 2000 + m(5000) \cdot 2000\\
&= \left( \frac{1}{875} + \frac{1}{780} + \frac{1}{685} \right) \cdot 2000\\
&\approx 0.00388476 \cdot 2000\\
&\approx 7.77\text{.}
\end{align*}
Thus, it takes the plane a bit less than \(8\) minutes to climb to an altitude of 6,000 feet.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5201}{}%
Using \(5\) subintervals,%
\begin{align*}
\int_{0}^{10000} m(h) \, dh &\approx M_5\\
&= m(1000) \cdot 2000 + m(3000) \cdot 2000 + m(5000) \cdot 2000\\
&+ m(7000) \cdot 2000 + m(9000) \cdot 2000\\
&= \left( \frac{1}{875} + \frac{1}{780} + \frac{1}{685} + \frac{1}{585} + \frac{1}{490} \right) \cdot 2000\\
&\approx 0.007634980475 \cdot 2000\\
&\approx 15.27\text{.}
\end{align*}
Thus, it takes the plane a bit more than \(15\) minutes to climb to an altitude of 10,000 feet.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5202}{}%
Note that in both of these computations, we are using \(M_n\) to denote the midpoint rule with \(n\) subintervals, and this ``\(M\)'' is different from the one we used earlier in \(M(h)\).%

\hypertarget{p-5206}{}%
In \hyperref[sec-4-4-FTC]{Section~\ref{sec-4-4-FTC}}, we learned the key role that antiderivatives play in the process of evaluating definite integrals exactly. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus tells us that if \(F\) is any antiderivative of \(f\), then%
\begin{equation*}
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5207}{}%
Furthermore, we realized that each elementary derivative rule developed in \hyperref[C-2]{Chapter~\ref{C-2}} leads to a corresponding elementary antiderivative, as summarized in \hyperref[T-4-4-Act2_2]{Table~\ref{T-4-4-Act2_2}}. Thus, if we wish to evaluate an integral such as%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^1 \left(x^3 - \sqrt{x} + 5^x \right) \,dx\text{,}
\end{equation*}
it is straightforward to do so, since we can easily antidifferentiate \(f(x) = x^3 - \sqrt{x} + 5^x\). Because one antiderivative of \(f\) is \(F(x) = \frac{1}{4}x^4 - \frac{2}{3}x^{\frac{3}{2}} + \frac{1}{\ln(5)}5^x\), the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus tells us that%
\begin{align*}
\int_0^1 \left(x^3 - \sqrt{x} + 5^x\right) \,dx &=  \left. \frac{1}{4}x^4 - \frac{2}{3}x^{\frac{3}{2}} + \frac{1}{\ln(5)}5^x\right|_0^1\\
&= \left( \frac{1}{4}(1)^4 - \frac{2}{3}(1)^{\frac{3}{2}} + \frac{1}{\ln(5)}5^1 \right) - \left( 0 - 0 + \frac{1}{\ln(5)}5^0 \right)\\
&= -\frac{5}{12} + \frac{4}{\ln(5)}\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5208}{}%
We see that we have a natural interest in being able to find such algebraic antiderivatives. We emphasize \emph{algebraic} antiderivatives, as opposed to any antiderivative, since we know by the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus that \(G(x) = \int_a^x f(t) \, dt\) is indeed an antiderivative of the given function \(f\), but one that still involves a definite integral. Our goal in this section is to ``undo'' the process of differentiation to find an algebraic antiderivative for a given function.%

\hypertarget{p-5209}{}%
In \hyperref[sec-2-5-chain]{Section~\ref{sec-2-5-chain}}, we learned the Chain Rule and how it can be applied to find the derivative of a composite function. In particular, if \(u\) is a differentiable function of \(x\), and \(f\) is a differentiable function of \(u(x)\), then%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx} \left[ f(u(x))  \right] = f'(u(x)) \cdot u'(x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5210}{}%
Here, \(f\) is considered the ``outer'' function and \(u\) the ``inner'' function. Thus, the chain rule says that the derivative of a composite function \(c(x) = f(u(x))\) is ``the derivative of the outer function, evaluated at the inner function, times the derivative of the inner function.''%

\hypertarget{p-5263}{}%
Whenever \(f\) is a familiar function whose antiderivative is known and \(u(x)\) is a linear function, it is  straightforward to antidifferentiate a function of the form%
\begin{equation*}
h(x) = f(u(x))\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-209}
\hypertarget{p-5264}{}%
The following example will demonstrate how to determine the general antiderivative of%
\begin{equation*}
h(x) = (5x-3)^6\text{.}
\end{equation*}
We can check the result by differentiating.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5265}{}%
For this composite function, the outer function \(f\) is \(f(u) = u^6\), while the inner function is \(u(x) = 5x - 3\). Since the antiderivative of \(f\) is \(F(u) = \frac{1}{7}u^7+C\), we see that the antiderivative of \(h\) is%
\begin{equation*}
H(x) = \frac{1}{7} (5x-3)^7 \cdot \frac{1}{5} + C = \frac{1}{35} (5x-3)^7 + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5266}{}%
The inclusion of the constant \(\frac{1}{5}\) is essential precisely because the derivative of the inner function is \(u'(x) = 5\). Indeed, if we now compute \(H'(x)\), we find by the Chain Rule (and Constant Multiple Rule) that%
\begin{equation*}
H'(x) = \frac{1}{35} \cdot 7(5x-3)^6 \cdot 5 = (5x-3)^6 = h(x)\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and thus \(H\) is indeed the general antiderivative of \(h\).%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-5267}{}%
Hence, in the special case where the outer function is familiar and the inner function is linear, we can antidifferentiate composite functions according to the following rule.%
\begin{assemblage}\label{assemblage-111}
\hypertarget{p-5268}{}%
If \(h(x) = f(ax + b)\) and \(F\) is a known algebraic antiderivative of \(f\), then the general antiderivative of \(h\) is given by%
\begin{equation*}
H(x) = \frac{1}{a} F(ax+b) + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-5269}{}%
It is useful to have shorthand notation that indicates the instruction to find an antiderivative. Thus, in a similar way to how the notation%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx} \left[ f(x) \right]
\end{equation*}
represents the derivative of \(f(x)\) with respect to \(x\), we use the notation of the \emph{indefinite integral}, \index{indefinite integral}%
\begin{equation*}
\int f(x) \, dx
\end{equation*}
to represent the general antiderivative of \(f\) with respect to \(x\). Returning to the earlier example with \(h(x) = (5x-3)^6\), we can rephrase the relationship between \(h\) and its antiderivative \(H\) through the notation%
\begin{equation*}
\int (5x-3)^6 \, dx = \frac{1}{35} (5x-6)^7 + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5270}{}%
When we find an antiderivative, we will often say that we \emph{evaluate an indefinite integral}. \index{indefinite integral!evaluate} Just as the notation \(\frac{d}{dx} [ \Box ]\) means ``find the derivative with respect to \(x\) of \(\Box\),'' the notation \(\int \Box \, dx\) means ``find a function of \(x\) whose derivative is \(\Box\).''%

A natural question arises from our recent work: what happens when the inner function is not linear? For example, can we find antiderivatives of such functions as%
\begin{equation*}
g(x) = x e^{x^2} \ \text{and}  \ h(x) = e^{x^2}?
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5300}{}%
It is important to remember that differentiation and antidifferentiation are almost-inverse processes (that they are not is due to the \(+C\) that arises when antidifferentiating). This almost-inverse relationship enables us to take any known derivative rule and rewrite it as a corresponding rule for an indefinite integral. For example, since%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx} \left[x^5\right] = 5x^4\text{,}
\end{equation*}
we can equivalently write%
\begin{equation*}
\int 5x^4 \, dx = x^5 + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5301}{}%
Recall that the Chain Rule states that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx} \left[ f(g(x)) \right] = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5302}{}%
Restating this relationship in terms of an indefinite integral,%
\begin{equation}
\int f'(g(x)) g'(x) \, dx = f(g(x))+C\text{.}\label{E-usubst}
\end{equation}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5303}{}%
\hyperref[E-usubst]{Equation~(\ref{E-usubst})} tells us that if we can view a given function as \(f'(g(x)) g'(x)\) for some appropriate choices of \(f\) and \(g\), then we can antidifferentiate the function by reversing the Chain Rule. Note that both \(g(x)\) and \(g'(x)\) appear in the form of \(f'(g(x)) g'(x)\); we will sometimes say that we seek to \emph{identify a function-derivative pair} \index{function-derivative pair} (\(g(x)\) and \(g'(x)\)) when trying to apply the rule in \hyperref[E-usubst]{Equation~(\ref{E-usubst})}.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5304}{}%
If we can identify a function-derivative pair, we will introduce a new variable \(u\) to represent the function \(g(x)\). With \(u = g(x)\), it follows in Leibniz notation that \(\frac{du}{dx} = g'(x)\), so that in terms of differentials\footnote{If we recall from the definition of the derivative that \(\frac{du}{dx} \approx \frac{\Delta{u}}{\Delta{x}}\) and use the fact that \(\frac{du}{dx} = g'(x)\), then we see that \(g'(x) \approx \frac{\Delta{u}}{\Delta{x}}\). Solving for \(\Delta u\), \(\Delta u \approx g'(x) \Delta x\). It is this last relationship that, when expressed in ``differential'' notation enables us to write \(du = g'(x) \, dx\) in the change of variable formula.\label{fn-54}}, \(du = g'(x)\, dx\). Now converting the indefinite integral to a new one in terms of \(u\), we have%
\begin{equation*}
\int f'(g(x)) g'(x) \, dx = \int f'(u) \,du\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5305}{}%
Provided that \(f'\) is an elementary function whose antiderivative is known, we can easily evaluate the indefinite integral in \(u\), and then go on to determine the desired overall antiderivative of \(f'(g(x)) g'(x)\). We call this process \emph{\(u\)-substitution}, and summarize the rule as follows:%

\hypertarget{p-5311}{}%
We can make two algebraic observations regarding the integrand, \(x^3 \cdot \sin (7x^4 + 3)\). First, \(\sin (7x^4 + 3)\) is a composite function; as such, we know we'll need a more sophisticated approach to antidifferentiating. Second, \(x^3\) is almost the derivative of \(7x^4 + 3\); the only issue is a missing constant. Thus, \(x^3\) and \((7x^4 + 3)\) are nearly a function-derivative pair. Furthermore, we know the antiderivative of \(f(u) = \sin(u)\). The combination of these observations suggests that we can evaluate the given indefinite integral by reversing the chain rule through \(u\)-substitution.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5312}{}%
Letting \(u\) represent the inner function of the composite function \(\sin (7x^4 + 3)\), we have \(u = 7x^4 + 3\), and thus \(\frac{du}{dx} = 28x^3\). In differential notation, it follows that \(du = 28x^3 \, dx\), and thus \(x^3 \, dx = \frac{1}{28} \, du\). The original indefinite integral may be slightly rewritten as%
\begin{equation*}
\int \sin (7x^4 + 3) \cdot x^3 \, dx\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and so by substituting \(u\) for \(7x^4 + 3\) and \(\frac{1}{28} \, du\) for \(x^3 \, dx\), it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
\int \sin (7x^4 + 3) \cdot x^3 \, dx = \int \sin(u) \cdot \frac{1}{28} \, du\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5313}{}%
Now we may evaluate the easier integral in \(u\), and then replace \(u\) by the expression \(7x^4 + 3\). Doing so, we find%
\begin{align*}
\int \sin (7x^4 + 3) \cdot x^3 \, dx &= \int \sin(u) \cdot \frac{1}{28} \, du\\
&= \frac{1}{28} \int \sin(u) \, du\\
&= \frac{1}{28} (-\cos(u)) + C\\
&= -\frac{1}{28} \cos(7x^4 + 3) + C\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5314}{}%
To check our work, we observe by the Chain Rule that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx} \left[ -\frac{1}{28}\cos(7x^4 + 3) \right] = -\frac{1}{28} \cdot (-1)\sin(7x^4 + 3) \cdot 28x^3 = \sin(7x^4 + 3) \cdot x^3\text{,}
\end{equation*}
which is indeed the original integrand.%

\subsubsection[{A Cautionary Tale}]{A Cautionary Tale}\label{subsection-135}
\hypertarget{p-5315}{}%
The \(u\)-substitution worked because the function multiplying \(\sin (7x^4 + 3)\) was \(x^3\). If instead that function was \(x^2\) or \(x^4\), the substitution process would not have worked. This is one of the primary challenges of antidifferentiation: slight changes in the integrand make tremendous differences. For instance, we can use \(u\)-substitution with \(u = x^2\) and \(du = 2xdx\) to find that%
\begin{align*}
\int xe^{x^2} \, dx &=  \int e^u \cdot \frac{1}{2} \, du\\
&= \frac{1}{2} \int e^u \, du\\
&= \frac{1}{2} e^u + C\\
&= \frac{1}{2} e^{x^2} + C\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5316}{}%
However, for the similar indefinite integral%
\begin{equation*}
\int e^{x^2} \, dx\text{,}
\end{equation*}
the \(u\)-substitution \(u = x^2\) is no longer possible because the factor of \(x\) is missing. Hence, part of the lesson of \(u\)-substitution is just how specialized the process is: it only applies to situations where, up to a missing constant, the integrand is the result of applying the Chain Rule to a different, related function.%

\subsection[{Evaluating Definite Integrals via \(u\)-substitution}]{Evaluating Definite Integrals via \(u\)-substitution}\label{subsection-136}
\hypertarget{p-5339}{}%
We have introduced \(u\)-substitution as a means to evaluate indefinite integrals of functions that can be written, up to a constant multiple, in the form \(f(g(x))g'(x)\). This same technique can be used to evaluate definite integrals involving such functions, though we need to be careful with the corresponding limits of integration. Consider, for instance, the definite integral%
\begin{equation*}
\int_2^5 xe^{x^2} \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5340}{}%
Whenever we write a definite integral, it is implicit that the limits of integration correspond to the variable of integration. To be more explicit, observe that%
\begin{equation*}
\int_2^5 xe^{x^2} \, dx = \int_{x=2}^{x=5} xe^{x^2} \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5341}{}%
When we execute a \(u\)-substitution, we change the \emph{variable} of integration; it is essential to note that this also changes the \emph{limits} of integration. For instance, with the substitution \(u = x^2\) and \(du = 2x \, dx\), it also follows that when \(x = 2\), \(u = 2^2 = 4\), and when \(x = 5\), \(u = 5^2 = 25\). Thus, under the change of variables of \(u\)-substitution, we now have%
\begin{align*}
\int_{x=2}^{x=5} xe^{x^2} \, dx    &= \int_{u=4}^{u=25} e^{u} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \, du\\
&= \left. \frac{1}{2}e^u \right|_{u=4}^{u=25}\\
&= \frac{1}{2}e^{25} - \frac{1}{2}e^4\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5342}{}%
Alternatively, we could consider the related indefinite integral \(\int xe^{x^2} \, dx\), find the antiderivative \(\frac{1}{2}e^{x^2}\) through \(u\)-substitution, and then evaluate the original definite integral. With that method, we'd have%
\begin{align*}
\int_{2}^{5} xe^{x^2} \, dx    &= \left. \frac{1}{2}e^{x^2} \right|_{2}^{5}\\
&= \frac{1}{2}e^{25} - \frac{1}{2}e^4\text{,}
\end{align*}
which is, of course, the same result.%

Let \(u = 1+4x^2\), so \(du=8x dx\) and \(xdx = \frac{1}{8} du\). Note that \(x=1\) implies \(u=5\) and \(x=2\) implies \(u=17\). Thus using method A.,%
\begin{gather*}

We'll use method B., so first consider the corresponding indefinite integral, \(\int e^{-x} (2e^{-x}+3)^{9} \, dx\), and let \(u=2e^{-x}+3\) so that \(du = -2e^{-x}dx\). We see \(e^{-x}dx = -\frac{1}{2}du\), and thus \(\int e^{-x} (2e^{-x}+3)^{9} \, dx = -\frac{1}{2} \int u^9 \, du = -\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{10} u^{10} + C = -\frac{1}{20}(2e^{-x}+3)^{10}\). Applying this antiderivative to the definite integral, we see that%
\begin{align*}
\int\limits_0^1 e^{-x} (2e^{-x}+3)^{9} \, dx &= \left. -\frac{1}{20}(2e^{-x}+3)^{10} \right|_0^1 \\

To find algebraic formulas for antiderivatives of more complicated algebraic functions, we need to think carefully about how we can reverse known differentiation rules. To that end, it is essential that we understand and recall known derivatives of basic functions, as well as the standard derivative rules.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-5373}{}%
The indefinite integral provides notation for antiderivatives. When we write ``\(\int f(x) \, dx\),'' we mean ``the general antiderivative of \(f\).''  In particular, if we have functions \(f\) and \(F\) such that \(F' = f\), the following two statements say the exact thing:%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx}[F(x)] = f(x) \ \text{and}  \ \int f(x) \, dx = F(x) + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
That is, \(f\) is the derivative of \(F\), and \(F\) is an antiderivative of \(f\).%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-5374}{}%
The technique of \(u\)-substitution helps us to evaluate indefinite integrals of the form \(\int f(g(x))g'(x) \, dx\) through the substitutions \(u = g(x)\) and \(du = g'(x) \, dx\), so that%
\begin{equation*}
\int f(g(x))g'(x) \, dx = \int f(u) \, du\text{.}
\end{equation*}
A key part of choosing the expression in \(x\) to be represented by \(u\) is the identification of a function-derivative pair. To do so, we often look for an ``inner'' function \(g(x)\) that is part of a composite function, while investigating whether \(g'(x)\) (or a constant multiple of \(g'(x)\)) is present as a multiplying factor of the integrand.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-5375}{}%
There are two methods to use \(u\)-substitution with a definite integral. In one method, first find the general antiderivative in terms of \(x \) and use the bounds of integration corresponding to \(x \) when using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. For the other method, change the bounds of integration  to correspond to \(u \) as a step of a \(u\)-substitution, integrate with respect to \(u \), and use the bounds corresponding to \(u \) when using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.%

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-3480}{}\hypertarget{p-5391}{}%
We let \(u = \cos(x)\), so \(du = -\sin(x) \ dx\). This change of variable transforms the integral into one we can integrate as follows:%
\begin{align*}
\int \tan(x) \, dx &= \int \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)} \ dx\\
&= -\int \frac{1}{u} \ du\\
&= -\ln(|u|) + C\\
&= -\ln(|\cos(x)| + C\\
&= \ln\left(|\cos(x)|^{-1}\right) + C\\
&= \ln\left(|\sec(x)|\right) + C\text{.}
\end{align*}
Note that we used the property of the logarithm that \(p \ln (z) = \ln(z^p)\) as well as the fact that \(\frac{1}{\cos(x)} = \sec(x)\) in order to simplify the result.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3481}{}\hypertarget{p-5392}{}%
We let \(u = \sin(x)\), so \(du = \cos(x) \ dx\). This change of variable transforms the integral into one we can integrate as follows:%
\begin{align*}
\int \cot(x) \, dx &= \int \frac{\cos(x)}{\sin(x)} \ dx\\
&= \int \frac{1}{u} \ du\\
&= \ln(|u|) + C\\
&= \ln(|\sin(x)| + C\\
&= -\ln\left(|\sin(x)|^{-1}\right) + C\\
&= -\ln\left(|\csc(x)|\right) + C\text{.}
\end{align*}
Note that here we used the fact that \(\ln(z) = (-1)(-1)\ln(z) = (-1) \ln(z^{-1})\) in order to simplify the result.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3482}{}\hypertarget{p-5393}{}%
We let \(u = \sec(x) + \tan(x)\), so it follows that \(du = \left(\sec(x)\tan(x)+\sec^2(x)\right) \ dx\). This change of variable shows that the basic structure of the integrand is simple and can be integrated as follows:%
\begin{align*}
\int \frac{\sec^2(x) + \sec(x) \tan(x)}{\sec(x) + \tan(x)} \, dx &= \int \frac{1}{u} \ du\\
&= \ln(|u|) + C\\
&= \ln\left(|\sec(x) + \tan(x)|\right) + C\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-3483}{}\hypertarget{p-5394}{}%
The numerator of \(\frac{\sec^2(x) + \sec(x) \tan(x)}{\sec(x) + \tan(x)}\) can be rewritten by removing the common factor of \(\sec(x)\) to obtain%
\begin{equation*}
\sec(x)\left(\sec(x) + \tan(x)\right)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
The integrand can then be simplified to%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\sec^2(x) + \sec(x) \tan(x)}{\sec(x) + \tan(x)} = \frac{\sec(x)\left(\sec(x) + \tan(x)\right)}{\sec(x) + \tan(x)} = \sec(x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-3484}{}\hypertarget{p-5395}{}%
Using the results of (c) and (d), we see that%
\begin{equation*}
\int \sec(x) \, dx = \int \frac{\sec^2(x) + \sec(x) \tan(x)}{\sec(x) + \tan(x)} \, dx = \ln\left(|\sec(x) + \tan(x)|\right) + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-3485}{}\hypertarget{p-5396}{}%
Following (c)-(e) we can evaluate \(int \csc(x) \, dx\) as follows. First, rewrite \(\csc(x)\) by multiplying by \(1 = \frac{\csc(x) + \cot(x)}{\csc(x) + \cot(x)}\), so that%
\begin{equation*}
\int \csc(x) \, dx = \int \frac{\csc(x)\left(\csc(x) + \cot(x)\right)}{\csc(x) + \cot(x)} \, dx = \int \frac{\csc^2(x) + \csc(x) \cot(x)}{\csc(x) + \cot(x)} \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Now we evaluate the last integral in the preceding equation with the substitution \(u = \csc(x) + \cot(x)\). Then \(du = -\left(\csc(x)\cot(x)+\csc^2(x)\right) \ dx\). This change of variable transforms the integral so that we can integrate:%
\begin{align*}
\int \frac{\csc^2(x) + \csc(x) \cot(x)}{\csc(x) + \cot(x)} \, dx &= - \int \frac{1}{u} \ dx\\
&= -\ln(|u|) + C\\
&= -\ln\left(|\csc(x) + \cot(x)|\right) + C\text{.}
\end{align*}
Connecting the equalities we have established in our work, we have shown that%
\begin{equation*}
\int \csc(x) \, dx = -\ln\left(|\csc(x) + \cot(x)|\right) + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}

Letting \(u = x-1\), we find that \(x = u+1\) and thus \(dx = du\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-3494}{}\hypertarget{p-5409}{}%
Using the change of variables in (a),%
\begin{equation*}

\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-3495}{}\hypertarget{p-5410}{}%
Using the fact that \(\sqrt{u} = u^{\frac{1}{2}}\) and distributing, we can evaluate the integral as follows:%
\begin{align*}
\int x \sqrt{x-1} \, dx &= \int (u+1) u^{\frac{1}{2}} \, du\\
&= \int \left(u^{\frac{3}{2}} + u^{\frac{1}{2}} \right) \, du\\

\item\hypertarget{li-3496}{}\hypertarget{p-5411}{}%
First, for \(\int x^2 \sqrt{x-1} \, dx\), we let \(u = x-1\) so that \(x = u+1\) and \(dx = du\). From there, our work is very similar to what we did in (b):%
\begin{align*}
\int x^2 \sqrt{x-1} \, dx &= \int (u+1)^2 u^{\frac{1}{2}} \, du\\
&= \int \left(u^2 + 2u + 1 \right) u^{\frac{1}{2}} \, du\\

\hypertarget{p-5412}{}%
For \(\int x \sqrt{x^2 - 1} \, dx\), despite the fact that the integral looks remarkably similar, the situation is quite different. We observe that with \(u = x^2 - 1\), it follows \(du = 2x \, dx\), so we have a standard function-derivative pair. Noting that \(x \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \, du\), it follows that%
\begin{align*}
\int x \sqrt{x^2 - 1} \, dx &= \int \sqrt{u} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \, du\\
&= \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3}u^{\frac{3}{2}} + C\\
&= \frac{1}{3} u^{\frac{3}{2}} + C\\
&= \frac{1}{3} (x^2-1)^{\frac{3}{2}} + C\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5413}{}%
In the situation where we have \((x-a)\) under a square root and a polynomial outside the square root, the substitution \(u = x-a\) will allow us to convert the integrand into an expression we can integrate by changing the form of the radical from \(\sqrt{x-a}\) to \(\sqrt{u}\). From there we are able to distribute and integrate an expression that is essentially a sum of (fractional) powers of \(u\). In the situation where a polynomial of degree higher than \(1\) (such as \(x^2 - 1\)) is under the radical, we likely have to be fortunate enough to have the derivative of said polynomial (up to a constant) outside the radical in order to be able to integrate, as we were in the last example.%

If we let \(u = \sin(x)\), then \(du = \cos(x) \, dx\). Since there is no cosine function present in the integrand, we don't have the needed function-derivative pair present in order to transform the integral into one we can evaluate.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3508}{}\hypertarget{p-5428}{}%
Using the Fundamental Trigonometric Identity, we observe that \(\sin^2(x) = 1-\cos^2(x)\), and thus%

By our work in (b), we see that \(\int \sin^3(x) \, dx = \int \sin(x) (1-\cos^2(x)) \, dx\), and in this integral we have the function-derivative pair that corresponds to \(u = \cos(x)\) and \(du = -\sin(x) \, dx\).%

Using this substitution and evaluating the resulting integral,%

The meaning of \(\int_0^{24} r(t) \, dt\) is the total power consumed in \(24\) hours, measured in megawatt-hours. This is because \(r(t)\) is measured in megawatts and \(\triangle t\) in hours, and thus in the Riemann sum that corresponds to the definite integral, the terms in the sum of the form \(r(t) \cdot \triangle t\) have units ``megawatt-hours''. Moreover, by integrating the rate of power consumption we get the total change in power consumed.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3522}{}\hypertarget{p-5445}{}%
In a typical day, we know that Mathland consumes \(\int_0^{24} r(t) \, dt\) megawatt-hours of power, and thus we seek to evaluate the integral%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^{24} r(t) \, dt = \int_0^{24} \left[ 4 + \sin(0.263t + 4.7) + \cos(0.526t+9.4) \right] \, dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
To do so, we use the subtitutions \(u = 0.263t + 4.7\) (so \(du = 0.263 \, dt\)) and \(w = 0.526t + 9.4\) (so \(dw = 0.526 \, dt\)) to help us antidifferentiate the two trigonometric expressions, and thus we find that%
\begin{equation*}
\int \sin(0.263t + 4.7) \, dt = \frac{1}{0.263} \int \sin(u) \, du = -\frac{1}{0.263} \cos(u) = -\frac{1}{0.263} \cos(0.263t + 4.7)
\end{equation*}
and%
\begin{equation*}
\int \cos(0.526t + 9.4) \, dt = \frac{1}{0.526} \int \cos(w) \, dw = \frac{1}{0.526} \sin(w) = \frac{1}{0.526} \sin(0.526t + 9.4)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Putting this all together and using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we have%
\begin{align*}
\int_0^{24} r(t) \, dt &= \left. 4t -\frac{1}{0.263} \cos(0.263t + 4.7) + \frac{1}{0.526} \sin(0.526t + 9.4) \right|_0^{24}\\
&= \left[ 4 \cdot 24 -\frac{1}{0.263} \cos(0.263 \cdot 24 + 4.7) + \frac{1}{0.526} \sin(0.526 \cdot 24 + 9.4) \right] - \left[ -\frac{1}{0.263} \cos(4.7) + \frac{1}{0.526} \sin(9.4) \right]\\
&\approx 95.7809
\end{align*}
megawatts of power used in \(24\) hours.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3523}{}We know that the average value of the rate function \(r\) on \([0,24]\) is%
\begin{equation*}
\displaystyle r_{\operatorname{AVG} [0,24]}  = \frac{1}{24-0} \int_{0}^{24} r(t) \, dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Thus, by our work in (c), we have that%
\begin{equation*}
\displaystyle r_{\operatorname{AVG} [0,24]}  \approx \frac{1}{24} \cdot 95.7809 = 3.99087
\end{equation*}
which is measured in megawatts.%

%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-5446}{}%
How do we evaluate indefinite integrals that involve products of basic functions such as \(\int x \sin(x) \, dx\) and \(\int x e^x \, dx\)?%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-5447}{}%
In the last section, we learned how to reverse the chain rule. How do we reverse other rules of differentiation? In this section, we'll tackle this question for the product rule of differentiation.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-5448}{}%
What is the method of integration by parts and how can we consistently apply it to integrate products of basic functions?%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-5449}{}%
How does the algebraic structure of functions guide us in identifying \(u\) and \(dv\) in using integration by parts?%
\end{itemize}
\end{objectives}
\hypertarget{p-5450}{}%
In \hyperref[sec-5-5-substitution]{Section~\ref{sec-5-5-substitution}}, we learned the technique of \(u\)-substitution for evaluating indefinite integrals. For example, the indefinite integral \(\int x^3 \sin(x^4) \, dx\) is perfectly suited to \(u\)-substitution, because one factor is a composite function and the other factor is the derivative (up to a constant) of the inner function. Recognizing the algebraic structure of a function can help us to find its antiderivative.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5451}{}%
Next we consider integrands with a different elementary algebraic structure: a product of basic functions. For instance, suppose we are interested in evaluating the indefinite integral%
\begin{equation*}
\int x \sin(x) \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5452}{}%
The integrand is the product of the basic functions \(f(x) = x\) and \(g(x) = \sin(x)\). We know that it is relatively complicated to compute the derivative of the product of two functions, so we should expect that antidifferentiating a product should be similarly involved. Intuitively, we expect that evaluating \(\int x \sin(x) \, dx\) will involve somehow reversing the Product Rule.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5453}{}%
To that end, in \hyperref[PA-5-4]{Example~\ref{PA-5-4}} we refresh our understanding of the Product Rule and then investigate some indefinite integrals that involve products of basic functions.%
\begin{assemblage}[The Product Rule of Differentiation]\label{assemblage-115}
\hypertarget{p-5454}{}%
In \hyperref[sec-2-3-prod-quot]{Section~\ref{sec-2-3-prod-quot}}, we developed the Product Rule and studied how it is employed to differentiate a product of two functions. In particular, recall that if \(f\) and \(g\) are differentiable functions of \(x\), then%
\begin{gather*}
\frac{d}{dx} \left[ f(x) \cdot g(x)  \right] = f(x) \cdot g'(x) + g(x) \cdot f'(x) \text{.}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-3555}{}\hypertarget{p-5485}{}%
Since the derivative of \(xe^x \) is \(xe^x + e^x \), then \(xe^x +C\) is the general antiderivative of \(xe^x + e^x \). Thus, we know that \(\int xe^x + e^x \, dx = xe^x + C\). We can check our answer by differentiating \(xe^x \), which we did in part a), to make sure we get the integrand, \(xe^x + e^x \).%
\item\hypertarget{li-3556}{}\hypertarget{p-5486}{}%
Since the derivative of \(e^x \sin(x) \) is \(e^x(\sin(x) + \cos(x)) \), then \(e^x\sin(x) +C\) is the general antiderivative of \(e^x(\sin(x) + \cos(x)) \). Thus, we know that \(\int e^x(\sin(x) + \cos(x)) \, dx=e^x \sin(x) + C\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-3557}{}\hypertarget{p-5487}{}%
Since the derivative of \(x^2\cos(x) \) is \(2x\cos(x) -x^2\sin(x) \), then \(x^2\cos(x)+C\) is the general antiderivative of \(2x\cos(x)-x^2\sin(x) \). Thus, we know that \(\int 2x\cos(x) - x^2 \sin(x) \, dx =x^2 \cos(x) + C\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-3558}{}\hypertarget{p-5488}{}%
Since the derivative of \(x\sin(x) \) is \(x\cos(x) + \sin(x) \), then \(x\sin(x) +C\) is the general antiderivative of \(x\cos(x)+ \sin(x) \). Thus, we know that \(\int x\cos(x) + \sin(x) \, dx=x\sin(x) + C\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-3559}{}\hypertarget{p-5489}{}%
Since the derivative of \(x\ln(x) \) is \(1+\ln(x) \), then \(x\ln(x) +C\) is the general antiderivative of \(1+ \ln(x) \). Thus, we know that \(\int 1 + \ln(x) \, dx = x\ln(x) + C \).%

%

%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-5490}{}%
Observe that the examples in part (b) work nicely because of the derivatives you were asked to  calculate in part (a). Each integrand in part (b) is precisely the result of differentiating one of the products of basic functions found in part (a). To see what happens when an integrand is still a product but not necessarily the result of differentiating a product of functions, we consider how to evaluate%
\begin{equation*}
\int x\cos(x) \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%

\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-3560}{}\hypertarget{p-5492}{}%
First, observe that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx} \left[ x\sin(x) \right] = x\cos(x) + \sin(x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Integrating both sides indefinitely and using the fact that the integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals, we find that%
\begin{equation*}
\int \left(\frac{d}{dx} \left[ x\sin(x) \right] \right) \, dx = \int  x\cos(x) \, dx +  \int \sin(x) \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
In this last equation, evaluate the indefinite integral on the left side of the equation as well as the rightmost indefinite integral on the right side of the equation.%
 \hypertarget{p-5493}{}%
From the \hyperref[sec-5-4-FTC2]{Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus~\ref{sec-5-4-FTC2}}, we know that \(\int \frac{d}{dx} \left[x\sin(x) \right] =x\sin(x) + C_1 \) where \(C_1 \) is any constant. We also know that \(\int \sin(x) \, dx = -\cos(x) + C_2 \) where \(C_2 \) is any constant. Thus, we obtain the following equation:%
\begin{gather*}
x\sin(x) + C_1 = \int x \cos(x) \, dx - \cos(x) + C_2

\subsection[{Reversing the Product Rule: Integration by Parts}]{Reversing the Product Rule: Integration by Parts}\label{subsection-138}
\index{integration by parts}\hypertarget{p-5498}{}%
\hyperref[PA-5-4-2]{Example~\ref{PA-5-4-2}} provides a clue to the general technique known as Integration by Parts, which comes from reversing the Product Rule. Recall that the Product Rule states that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx} \left[ f(x) g(x) \right] = f(x) g'(x) + g(x)  f'(x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5499}{}%
Integrating both sides of this equation indefinitely with respect to \(x\), we find%
\begin{equation}
\int \frac{d}{dx} \left[ f(x)  g(x) \right] \, dx = \int f(x) g'(x) \, dx + \int g(x)  f'(x) \, dx\text{.}\label{E-intprod}
\end{equation}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5500}{}%
On the left side of \hyperref[E-intprod]{Equation~(\ref{E-intprod})}, we have the indefinite integral of the derivative of a function. Temporarily omitting the constant that may arise, we have%
\begin{equation}
f(x)  g(x) = \int f(x) g'(x) \, dx + \int g(x)  f'(x) \, dx\text{.}\label{E-intprod2}
\end{equation}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5501}{}%
We solve for the first indefinite integral on the left to generate the rule%
\begin{equation}
\int f(x) g'(x) \, dx  = f(x)  g(x) -  \int g(x)  f'(x) \, dx\text{.}\label{E-IBP1}
\end{equation}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5502}{}%
Often we express \hyperref[E-IBP1]{Equation~(\ref{E-IBP1})} in terms of the variables \(u\) and \(v\), where \(u = f(x)\) and \(v = g(x)\). In differential notation, \(du = f'(x) \, dx\) and \(dv = g'(x) \, dx\), so we can state the rule for \emph{Integration by Parts} in its most common form as follows:%
\begin{assemblage}[Integration by Parts Formula]\label{assemblage-116}
\hypertarget{p-5503}{}%
If \(u=f(x) \) and \(v=g(x) \), then \(du=f'(x) \, dx\) and \(dv=g'(x) \, dx \). Then we can change \hyperref[E-IBP1]{Equation~(\ref{E-IBP1})} to the following equation:%
\begin{equation*}
\int u \, dv  = uv -  \int v \, du\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-5504}{}%
A way to remember the integration by parts formula is the following picture:%
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/5_6_Parts_Figure.svg}
\hypertarget{p-5505}{}%
Here, the curve \((u(x), v(x))\) cuts a rectangle in half. There are two ways to compute the area of the rectangle: \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-3563}{}The first is the usual length times height. The length of the rectangle is \(u\), and the height is \(v\), so the area of the rectangle is \(uv\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-3564}{}The other way to find the area of the rectangle is to add the area under the curve and above the curve. The area under the curve comes from integrated \(v(x)\) with respect to the horizontal axis (the \(u\)-axis), so the area under the curve is \(\int v du\). Similarly, the area above the curve is integrated with respect to the vertical axis, so its area is \(\int u dv\). Summing these gives the total area of the rectangle is \(\int u dv + \int v du \).%
\end{enumerate}
 Comparing the two methods tells us that \(uv = \int u dv + \int v du \), and rearranging this expression gives the integration by parts formula.%
\begin{assemblage}[Method of Integration by Parts]\label{assemblage-117}
\hypertarget{p-5506}{}%
To apply integration by parts to evaluate an indefinite integral, perform the following steps: \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-5507}{}%
Look for a product of basic functions that we can identify as \(u\) and \(dv\). We need to antidifferentiate \(dv \) to find \(v\), so keep this in mind when picking \(u\) and \(dv \).%
\item{}Once \(u, v, du, \) and \(dv \) have been identified, apply the integration by parts formula.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-5508}{}%
If evaluating \(\int v \, du\) is not more difficult than evaluating \(\int u \, dv\), then this substitution usually proves to be fruitful.%
\end{itemize}
 Note: there are some exceptions where \(\int v\, du \) is just as difficult as \(\int u \, dv \) but integration by parts is still helpful. We cover those cases in \hyperref[IBP-MT]{Using Integration by Parts Multiple Times~\ref{IBP-MT}}.%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-5509}{}%
To demonstrate this method, we consider the following example.%
\begin{example}[]\label{Ex-5-4-IBP}
\hypertarget{p-5510}{}%
Evaluate the indefinite integral%
\begin{equation*}
\int x\cos(x) \, dx
\end{equation*}
using integration by parts.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-282}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-5511}{}%
When we use integration by parts, we have a choice for \(u\) and \(dv\). In this problem, we can either let \(u = x\) and \(dv = \cos(x) \, dx\), or let \(u = \cos(x)\) and \(dv = x \, dx\). While there is not a universal rule for how to choose \(u\) and \(dv\), a good guideline is this: do so in a way that \(\int v \, du\) is at least as simple as the original problem \(\int u \, dv\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5512}{}%
This leads us to choose\footnote{Observe that if we considered the alternate choice, and let \(u = \cos(x)\) and \(dv = x \, dx\), then \(du = -\sin(x) \, dx\) and \(v = \frac{1}{2}x^2\), from which we would write \(\int x\cos(x) \, dx = \frac{1}{2}x^2 \cos(x) - \int \frac{1}{2}x^2 (-\sin(x)) \, dx\). Thus we have replaced the problem of integrating \(x \cos(x)\) with that of integrating \(\frac{1}{2}x^2 \sin(x)\); the latter is clearly more complicated, which shows that this alternate choice is not as helpful as the first choice.\label{fn-56}}\(u = x\) and \(dv = \cos(x) \, dx\), from which it follows that \(du = 1 \, dx\) and \(v = \sin(x)\). With this substitution, the rule for integration by parts tells us that%
\begin{equation*}
\int x \cos(x) \, dx = x \sin(x) - \int \sin(x) \cdot 1 \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5513}{}%
All that remains to do is evaluate the (simpler) integral \(\int \sin(x) \cdot 1 \, dx\). Doing so, we find%
\begin{equation*}
\int x \cos(x) \, dx = x \sin(x) - (-\cos(x)) + C = x\sin(x) + \cos(x) + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Observe that when we get to the final stage of evaluating the last remaining antiderivative, it is at this step that we include the integration constant, \(+C\).%

The general technique of integration by parts involves trading one integral for another since it converts the problem of evaluating \(\int u \, dv\) to that of evaluating \(\int v \, du\). It is therefore important that our choice of \(u\) and \(v\) make the problem easier instead of harder! In \hyperref[Ex-5-4-IBP]{Example~\ref{Ex-5-4-IBP}}, the original integral to evaluate was \(\int x \cos(x) \,dx\), and through the substitution provided by integration by parts, we were instead able to evaluate \(\int \sin(x) \cdot 1 \, dx\). Note that the original function \(x\) was replaced by its derivative, while \(\cos(x)\) was replaced by its antiderivative.%

\hypertarget{p-5535}{}%
Sometimes integration by parts is not an obvious choice, but the technique is appropriate nonetheless. Integration by parts allows us to replace one function in a product with its derivative while replacing the other with its antiderivative. For instance, consider evaluating%
\begin{equation*}
\int \arctan(x) \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5536}{}%
Initially, this problem seems ill-suited to integration by parts, since there does not appear to be a product of functions present. But if we note that \(\arctan(x) = \arctan(x) \cdot 1\), and realize that we know the derivative of \(\arctan(x)\) as well as the antiderivative of \(1\), we see the possibility for the substitution \(u = \arctan(x)\) and \(dv = 1 \, dx\). We explore this substitution further in \hyperref[act-5-4-2]{Example~\ref{act-5-4-2}}.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5537}{}%
In a related problem, consider \(\int t^3 \sin(t^2) \, dt\). Observe that there is a composite function present in \(\sin(t^2)\), which normally suggests \(u\)-substitution, but there is not an obvious function-derivative pair, as we have \(t^3\) (rather than simply \(t\)) multiplying \(\sin(t^2)\). In this problem we use both \(u\)-substitution and integration by parts. First we write \(t^3 = t \cdot t^2\) and consider the indefinite integral%
\begin{equation*}
\int t \cdot t^2 \cdot \sin(t^2) \, dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
We let \(z = t^2\) so that \(dz = 2t \, dt\), and thus \(t \, dt = \frac{1}{2} \, dz\). (We are using the variable \(z\) to perform a ``\(z\)-substitution'' first so that we may then apply integration by parts.) Under this \(z\)-substitution, we now have%
\begin{equation*}
\int t \cdot t^2 \cdot \sin(t^2) \, dt = \int z \cdot \sin(z) \cdot \frac{1}{2} \, dz\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5538}{}%
The resulting integral can be evaluated by parts. This, too, is explored further in \hyperref[act-5-4-2]{Example~\ref{act-5-4-2}}.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5539}{}%
These problems show that we sometimes must think creatively in choosing the variables for substitution in integration by parts, and that we may need to use substitution for an additional change of variables.%

We use integration by parts with \(u = \arctan(x)\) and \(dv = dx\). So \(du = \dfrac{1}{1+x^2}dx\) and \(v = x\).%
\begin{align*}
\int{\arctan(x) dx} \amp = uv - \int{v du}\\
\amp = x\arctan(x) - \int\frac{x}{1+x^2} dx
\end{align*}
For the integral in the last equation, use the substitution \(z = 1+x^2\) and \(dz = 2x\, dx\).%
\begin{align*}
\int \arctan(x) dx  \amp = x\arctan(x) -\int\frac{x}{1+x^2} dx\\
\amp = x\arctan(x) - \frac{1}{2} \int \frac{1}{z} dz\\
\amp = x\arctan(x) - \frac{1}{2} \ln(z) + C\\
\amp = x\arctan(x) - \frac{1}{2} \ln \left( 1 + x^2 \right) + C
\end{align*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-3595}{}\hypertarget{p-5554}{}%
Using \(u = \ln(z)\) and \(dv = dz\), we obtain \(du = \dfrac{1}{z} dz\) and \(v = z\). So%
\begin{align*}
\int \ln(z) dz \amp = z \ln(z) - \int dz\\
\amp = z \ln(z) - z + C
\end{align*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-3596}{}\hypertarget{p-5555}{}%
Using \(z = t^2\), we obtain \(dz = 2t dt\) and \(\dfrac{1}{2} dz = t dt\). So%
\begin{align*}
\int t^3 \sin(t^2) dt \amp = \int t^2 \sin(t^2) \cdot t dt\\
\amp = \int z \sin(z) \frac{1}{2} dz\\
\amp = \frac{1}{2} \int z \sin(z) dz
\end{align*}
Now using integration by parts with \(u = z\) and \(dv = \sin(z) dz\), we obtain \(du = dz\) and \(v = -\cos(z)\). So%
\begin{align*}
\int t^3 \sin(t^2) dt \amp = \frac{1}{2} \int z \sin(z) dz\\
\amp = \frac{1}{2} \left( -z \cos(z) + \int \cos(z) dz \right)\\
\amp = \frac{1}{2} \left( -z \cos(z) + \sin(z) \right) + C
\end{align*}
Finally, we use \(z = t^2\) and obtain%
\begin{equation*}
\int t^3 \sin(t^2) dt = \frac{1}{2} \left( -t^2 \cos\left(t^2 \right) + \sin\left(t^2\right) \right) +C\text{.}

\amp = \frac{1}{3} \int z e^z dz
\end{align*}
Now use integration by parts with \(u = z\) and \(dv = e^z dz\). So \(du = dz\) and \(v = e^z\).%
\begin{align*}
\int s^5 e^{s^3} ds \amp = \frac{1}{3} \int z e^z dz\\
\amp = \frac{1}{3} \left( z e^z - \int e^z dz \right)\\
\amp = \frac{1}{3} \left( z e^z - e^z \right) + C\\
\amp = \frac{1}{3} \left( s^3 e^{s^3} - e^{s^3} \right) + C
\end{align*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-3598}{}\hypertarget{p-5557}{}%
Using \(z = e^t\), we see that \(dz = e^t dt\) and so%
\begin{align*}
\int e^{2t} \cos\left( e^t \right) dt \amp = \int e^t \cos\left( e^t \right) \cdot e^t  dt\\
\amp = \int z \cos(z) dz
\end{align*}
In \hyperref[Ex-5-4-IBP]{Example~\ref{Ex-5-4-IBP}}, we saw that%
\begin{equation*}
\int z \cos(z) dz = z \sin(z) + \cos(z) + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Combining these two results, we obtain%
\begin{align*}
\int e^{2t} \cos\left( e^t \right) dt \amp = \int z \cos(z) dz\\
\amp = z \sin(z) + \cos(z) + C\\
\amp = e^t \sin \left( e^t \right) + \cos \left( e^t \right) + C

\hypertarget{p-5558}{}%
Integration by parts is well suited to integrating the product of basic functions, allowing us to trade a given integrand for a new one where one function in the product is replaced by its derivative, and the other is replaced by its antiderivative. The goal in this trade of \(\int u \, dv\) for \(\int v \, du\) is that the new integral be simpler to evaluate than the original one. Sometimes it is necessary to apply integration by parts more than once in order to evaluate a given integral.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-220}
\hypertarget{p-5559}{}%
Evaluate \(\int t^2 e^t \, dt\).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-285}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-5560}{}%
Let \(u = t^2\) and \(dv = e^t \, dt\). Then \(du = 2t \, dt\) and \(v = e^t\), and thus%
\begin{equation*}
\int t^2 e^t \, dt = t^2 e^t - \int 2t e^t \, dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5561}{}%
The integral on the right side is simpler to evaluate than the one on the left, but it still requires integration by parts. Now letting \(u = 2t\) and \(dv = e^t \, dt\), we have \(du = 2\, dt\) and \(v = e^t\), so that%
\begin{equation*}
\int t^2 e^t \, dt = t^2 e^t - \left( 2t e^t - \int 2 e^t \, dt \right)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5562}{}%
(Note the parentheses, which remind us to distribute the minus sign to the entire value of the integral \(\int 2t e^t \, dt\).) The final integral on the right is a basic one; evaluating that integral and distributing the minus sign, we find%
\begin{equation*}
\int t^2 e^t \, dt = t^2 e^t - 2t e^t +  2 e^t + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-5563}{}%
Of course, even more than two applications of integration by parts may be necessary. In the preceding example, if the integrand had been \(t^3e^t\), we would have had to use integration by parts three times.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5564}{}%
Next, we consider the slightly different scenario where multiple uses of integration by parts are necessary.%

\hypertarget{p-5568}{}%
We can choose to let \(u\) be either \(e^t\) or \(\cos(t)\); we pick \(u = \cos(t)\), and thus \(dv = e^t \, dt\). With \(du = -\sin(t) \, dt\) and \(v = e^t\), integration by parts tells us that%
\begin{equation*}
\int e^t \cos(t) \, dt = e^t \cos(t) - \int e^t (-\sin(t))\, dt\text{,}
\end{equation*}
or equivalently that%
\begin{equation}
\int e^t \cos(t) \, dt = e^t \cos(t) + \int e^t \sin(t) \, dt\text{.}\label{E_IBPtwice}
\end{equation}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5569}{}%
The new integral has the same algebraic structure as the original one. While the overall situation isn't necessarily better than what we started with, it hasn't gotten worse. Thus, we proceed to integrate by parts again. This time we let \(u = \sin(t)\) and \(dv = e^t \, dt\), so that \(du = \cos(t) \, dt\) and \(v = e^t\), which implies%
\begin{equation}
\int e^t \cos(t) \, dt = e^t \cos(t) + \left( e^t \sin(t) - \int e^t \cos(t) \, dt \right)\text{.}\label{E_IBPtwice2}
\end{equation}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5570}{}%
We seem to be back where we started, as two applications of integration by parts has led us back to the original problem, \(\int e^t \cos(t) \, dt\). But if we look closely at \hyperref[E_IBPtwice2]{Equation~(\ref{E_IBPtwice2})}, we see that we can use algebra to solve for the value of the desired integral. Adding \(\int e^t \cos(t) \, dt\) to both sides of the equation, we have%
\begin{equation*}
2 \int e^t \cos(t) \, dt = e^t \cos(t) +  e^t \sin(t)\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and therefore%
\begin{equation*}
\int e^t \cos(t) \, dt = \frac{1}{2} \left( e^t \cos(t) +  e^t \sin(t) \right) + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}

\hypertarget{p-5604}{}%
Both integration techniques we have discussed apply in relatively limited circumstances. It is not hard to find examples of functions for which neither technique produces an antiderivative; indeed, there are many, many functions that appear elementary but that do not have an elementary algebraic antiderivative. For instance, neither \(u\)-substitution nor integration by parts proves fruitful for the indefinite integrals%
\begin{equation*}
\int e^{x^2} \, dx \ \ \text{and}  \ \ \int x \tan(x) \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
While there are other integration techniques, some of which we will consider briefly, none of them enables us to find an algebraic antiderivative for \(e^{x^2}\) or \(x \tan(x)\). We do know from the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus that we can construct an integral antiderivative for each function; \(F(x) = \int_0^x e^{t^2} \, dt\) is an antiderivative of \(f(x) = e^{x^2}\), and \(G(x) = \int_0^{x} t \tan(t) \, dt\) is an antiderivative of \(g(x) = x \tan(x)\). But finding an elementary algebraic formula that doesn't involve integrals for either \(F\) or \(G\) turns out not only to be impossible through \(u\)-substitution or integration by parts, but indeed impossible altogether. Antidifferentiation is much harder in general than differentiation.%

Through the method of integration by parts, we can evaluate indefinite integrals, such as \(\int x \sin(x) \, dx\) and \(\int x \ln(x) \, dx\),  that involve products of basic functions. Using a substitution enables us to trade one of the functions in the product for its derivative, and the other for its antiderivative, in an effort to find a different product of functions that is easier to integrate.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-5607}{}%
If the algebraic structure of an integrand is a product of basic functions in the form \(\int f(x) g'(x) \, dx\), we can use the substitution \(u = f(x)\) and \(dv = g'(x) \,dx\) and apply the rule%
\begin{equation*}
\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du
\end{equation*}
to evaluate the original integral \(\int f(x) g'(x) \, dx\) by instead evaluating%
\begin{equation*}
\int v \, du = \int f'(x) g(x) \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-5608}{}%
When deciding to integrate by parts, we have to select both \(u\) and \(dv\). That selection is guided by the overall principle that the new integral \(\int v \, du\) not be more difficult than the original integral \(\int u \, dv\). In addition, it is often helpful to recognize if one of the functions present is much easier to differentiate than antidifferentiate (such as \(\ln(x)\)), in which case that function often is best assigned the variable \(u\). In addition, \(dv\) must be a function that we can antidifferentiate.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-5609}{}%
Sometimes, integration by parts must be used more than once, or with another technique like \(u\)-substitution.%

We first write%

\int e^{2x} \cos(e^x) \, dx = \int e^x \cdot e^x \cos(e^x) \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Letting \(z = e^x\), we have \(dz = e^x \, dx\), and thus%

We can evaluate the integral \(\int z \cos(z) \, dz\) using integration by parts in the standard way with \(u = z\) and \(dv = \cos(z) \, dz\). Doing so,%
\begin{equation*}
\int z \cos(z) \, dz = z \sin(z) - \int \sin(z) \, dz = z \sin(z) + \cos(z) + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Returning to the original integral in \(x\) and using the substitution we first used with \(z\), we have shown that%
\begin{equation*}
\int e^{2x} \cos(e^x) \, dx = e^x \sin(e^x) + \cos(e^x) + C\text{.}

\begin{align*}
\int e^{2x} \cos(e^{2x}) \, dx &= \int \cos(u) \cdot \frac{1}{2} \, du\\
&= \frac{1}{2} \sin(u) + C\\

For the first integral, \(\int e^{2x} \sin(e^x) \, dx\), since \(e^x\) is the inside function in the composition, we let \(z = e^x\), so \(dz = e^x \, dx\), and write \(e^{2x} = e^x \cdot e^x\). Hence,%
\begin{equation*}
\int e^{2x} \sin(e^x) \, dx = \int e^x \cdot e^x \sin(e^x) \, dx = \int z \sin(z) \, dz\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Using the standard integration by parts with \(u = z\) and \(dv = \sin(z) \, dz\), we find%
\begin{equation*}
\int z \sin(z) \, dz = sin(z) - z\cos(z) + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Re-substituting from \(z\) back to \(x\), we've found that%
\begin{equation*}
\int e^{2x} \sin(e^x) \, dx = sin(e^x) - z\cos(e^x) + C\text{.}

\item{}\hypertarget{p-5644}{}%
The integral \(\int e^{3x} \sin(e^{3x}) \, dx\) can be evaluated using a \(u\)-substitution since \(u = e^{3x}\) is present to form a function-derivative pair with \(du = 3e^{3x}\). It follows that%
\begin{equation*}
\int e^{3x} \sin(e^{3x}) \, dx = \int \sin(u) \cdot \frac{1}{3} \, du = -\frac{1}{3} \cos(u) + C = -\frac{1}{3} \cos(e^{3x}) + C\text{.}

\item{}\hypertarget{p-5645}{}%
For the final integral, \(\int xe^{x^2} \cos(e^{x^2}) \sin(e^{x^2}) \, dx\), we first observe by the chain rule that \(\frac{d}{dx}\left[e^{x^2}\right] = 2xe^{x^2}\), which shows that we have a function-derivative pair present. Using the substitution \(z = e^{x^2}\), it follows \(dz = 2xe^{x^2} \, dx\), and therefore%
\begin{equation*}
\int xe^{x^2} \cos(e^{x^2}) \sin(e^{x^2}) \, dx = \int \cos(z) \sin(z) \cdot \frac{1}{2} \, dz\text{.}
\end{equation*}
The new integral in \(z\) can be evaluated using several different approaches, including \(u\)-substitution with \(u = \sin(z)\), \(du = \cos(z) \, dz\). Doing so,%
\begin{equation*}
\int \cos(z) \sin(z) \cdot \frac{1}{2} \, dz = \frac{1}{2} \int u  \, du = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} u^2 + C = \frac{1}{4} \sin^2(z) + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Returning to the original integral in \(x\) and our earlier work, substituting backward we find that%
\begin{equation*}
\int xe^{x^2} \cos(e^{x^2}) \sin(e^{x^2}) \, dx = \frac{1}{4} \sin^2(e^{x^2}) + C\text{.}

\item\hypertarget{li-3676}{}\hypertarget{p-5665}{}%
We will use a \(u\)-substitution with \(u = x^3\) because the integrand involves a composite function with \(x^3\) as the innermost function and because \(du = 3x^2 \, dx\) involves the factor \(x^2\) which is also present in the integrand. When we make this substitution we will have \(x^2 \ dx = \frac{1}{3} \ du\) and the integral can be evaluated as follows:%
\begin{align*}
\int x^2 \cos(x^3) \ dx &= \frac{1}{3} \int \cos(u) \ du\\
&= \frac{1}{3} \sin(u) + C\\
&= \frac{1}{3} \sin(x^3) + C\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-3677}{}\hypertarget{p-5666}{}%
We might try substituting \(z = x^3/\), since there is a composite function in the integrand. In this case we have \(dz = 3x^2 \, dx\). To make this substitution we need to rewrite the integrand as%
\begin{equation*}
x^5 \cos(x^3) = x^3 \left[x^2 \cos(x^3) \right]
\end{equation*}
and notice that \(x^3 = z\). Then%
\begin{equation*}
\int x^5 \cos(x^3) \ dx = \frac{1}{3} \int z \cos(z) \ dz\text{.}
\end{equation*}
We can then try integration by parts on this last integral with%
\begin{align*}
u &= z, \ du = dz\\
dv & = \cos(z) \, dz, \ v = \sin(z)
\end{align*}
We then have%
\begin{align*}
\int x^5 \cos(x^3) \ dx &= \frac{1}{3} \int z \cos(z) \ dz\\
&= \frac{1}{3} \left(z\sin(z) - \int \sin(z) \ dz \right)\\
&= \frac{1}{3} \left(z\sin(z) + \cos(z) \right) + C\\
&= \frac{1}{3} \left(x^3\sin(x^3) + \cos(x^3) \right) + C\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-3678}{}\hypertarget{p-5667}{}%
Since the logarithm function changes to a rational function when we differentiate it, using integration by parts with \(u = \ln(x^2) = 2\ln(x)\) will make the resulting integral easier to evaluate. So we let%
\begin{align*}
u &= \ln(x^2), \ du = \frac{2}{x} \ dx\\
dv & = x \ dx , \ v = \frac{x^2}{2}
\end{align*}
and then integration by parts yields%
\begin{align*}
\int x ln(x^2) \ dx &= \frac{x^2}{2} \ln(x^2) - \int \left(\frac{2}{x}\right) \left(\frac{x^2}{2}\right) \ dx\\
&= \frac{x^2}{2} \ln(x^2) - \int x \ dx\\
&= \frac{x^2}{2} \ln(x^2) - \frac{x^2}{2} + C\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-3679}{}\hypertarget{p-5668}{}%
We might try a substitution with \(u = x^4\), but then \(du = 4x^3 \ dx\) and there is no factor of \(x^3\) in the integrand to allow us to complete this substitution. If we attempt to integrate by parts, then only option is to let \(u = sin(x^4)\) which makes \(du = 4x^3 \cos(x^4)\) and we only make the integral more complicated. This is one integral we cannot evaluate with the tools we have.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3680}{}\hypertarget{p-5669}{}%
We will try a \(u\)-substitution with \(u = x^4\), because the integrand involves a composite function with \(x^4\) as the innermost function and because \(du = 4x^3 \, dx\) involves the factor \(x^3\) which is also present in the integrand. When we make this substitution we  have \(x^3 \ dx = \frac{1}{4} \ du\) and the integral can be evaluated as follows:%
\begin{align*}
\int x^3 \sin(x^4) \ dx &= \frac{1}{4} \int \sin(u) \ du\\
&= -\frac{1}{4} \cos(u) + C\\
&= -\frac{1}{4} \cos(x^4) + C\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-3681}{}\hypertarget{p-5670}{}%
We will use integration by parts. Notice that%
\begin{equation*}
\int x^7 \sin(x^4) \ dx = \int x^4 \left[x^3 \sin(x^4)\right] \ dx
\end{equation*}
and we have a factor we can differentiate (\(x^3\)) and one we can integrate (\(x^3 \sin(x^4)\)) (as we did in part (e)). So we let%
\begin{align*}
u &= x^3, \ du = 3x^2 \ dx\\
dv & = x^3 \sin(x^4) \ dx , \ v = -\frac{1}{4} \cos(x^4)
\end{align*}
Integration by parts formula now gives%
\begin{equation*}
\int x^7 \sin(x^4) \ dx = -\frac{1}{4} x^4 \cos(x^4) + \int x^3 \cos(x^4) \ dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
This last integral is essentially the same as obtaining \(v\) from \(dv\), so we will make the substitution \(z = x^4\) with \(dz = 4x^3 \ dx\). Changing variables in the last integral gives us%
\begin{align*}
\int x^7 \sin(x^4) \ dx &= -\frac{1}{4} x^4 \cos(x^4) + \int x^3 \cos(x^4) \ dx\\
&= -\frac{1}{4} x^4 \cos(x^4) + \frac{1}{4} \int \cos(z) \ dz\\
&= -\frac{1}{4} x^4 \cos(x^4) + \frac{1}{4} \sin(z) + C\\
&= -\frac{1}{4} x^4 \cos(x^4) + \frac{1}{4} \sin(x^4) + C\text{.}

How does the method of trigonometric substitutions help us find antiderivatives of functions that may include expressions like \(\sqrt{a^2-x^2}\), \(a^2 + x^2 \), and \(\sqrt{a^2 + x^2} \) where \(a \) is any real number?%

We have learned two antidifferentiation techniques: \(u\)-substitution and integration by parts. The former is used to reverse the chain rule, while the latter is used to reverse the product rule. But we have seen that each works only in specialized circumstances. For example, while \(\int \frac{2x+4}{x^2+4x+13} \, dx\) may be evaluated by \(u\)-substitution and \(\int x e^x \, dx\) by integration by parts, neither method provides a route to evaluate \(\int \frac{1}{x^2+4x+13} \, dx\). Many rational functions, a quotient of two polynomials, require more powerful algebraic manipulation techniques as well as more sophisticated integration techniques.%

The second may be solved using IBP with \(u = x^2 \ , dv = \sin(x) \, dx \) The third can not be solved using substitution or IBP. The last one can be solve using a combination. First do a substitution with \(w = x^3 \ , dw = 3x^2 \, dx \) to convert the integral to \(\frac{1}{3} \int w \sin(w) \, dw \). This may be solved using IBP with \(u = w \) and \(dv = \sin(w) \, dw. \)%

The third integral requires algebraic manipulation before you can successfully use a substitution. We can evaluate \(\int \frac{2x+3}{1+x^2} \, dx \) by recognizing that \(\frac{2x+3}{1+x^2} =\frac{2x}{1+x^2} + \frac{3}{1+x^2}\) so we can split the original integral into two integrals. Then, evaluate \(\int \frac{2x}{1+x^2} \, dx \) with the substitution \(u=1+x^2 \ , du=2x \, dx \) and evaluate \(\int \frac{3}{1+x^2} \, dx \) by following \hyperref[T-4-4-Act2_2]{Table~\ref{T-4-4-Act2_2}}. The fourth integral can be found by using the substitution \(u=e^x \ , du=e^x \, dx \) which transforms the integral to \(\int \frac{1}{1+u^2} \, du \).

The first integral can be evaluated by using integration by parts with \(u= \ln(x) \) and \(dv=x \, dx \). The second integral is evaluated by using the substitution \(u=\ln(x) \ , du= \frac{1}{x} \, dx \). The third integral cannot be solved by only using the methods of integration by parts or substitution. In fact, one solution to evaluate it involves first using integration by parts then using a method called \hyperref[PT]{partial fractions~\ref{PT}}. The fourth integral can be evaluated by using both a substitution and integration by parts. First, perform the substitution \(w=1+x^2 \ , dw= 2x \, dx \) which transforms the integral to \(\frac{1}{2} \int \ln(w) \, dw \). Integration by parts can be used to evaluate this with \(u=\ln(w) \) and \(dv=dx \).%

The third integral can be evaluated by using the substitution \(u=1-x^2 \ , du=-2x\, dx \). The fourth integral cannot be solved with standard substitution, integration by parts, or a combination of both. We will need a new style of substitution called \hyperref[Trig-Sub]{trigonometric substitution~\ref{Trig-Sub}} which will be discussed in this section.%

\subsection[{The Method of Partial Fractions}]{The Method of Partial Fractions}\label{PT}
\index{partial fractions}\hypertarget{p-5688}{}%
The method of partial fractions is used to integrate some rational functions. A rational function is a function that can be written as a quotient of polynomials.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5689}{}%
For example, consider \(\int \frac{1}{x(x-1)}dx\). It may not be immediately obvious how to integrate this expression, but algebraically rewriting the integrand will make it easy:%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{x(x-1)}= \frac{1}{x}-\frac{1}{x-1}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Thus,%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{1}{x(x-1)}dx= \int\frac{1}{x}dx - \int \frac{1}{x-1}dx = \ln|x|-\ln|x-1|+C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
The algebraic rewriting \(\frac{1}{x(x-1)}= \frac{1}{x}-\frac{1}{x-1}\) is called a \terminology{partial fraction decomposition}, and we will use this technique throughout the section to find the integrals of rational functions.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5690}{}%
The goal of partial fractions is to reverse the process of finding a common denominator, so the method works best when the denominator can be factored into smaller degree polynomials. Let's look at another example of partial fractions. A summary of the method of partial fractions and why it helps with evaluating integrals will follow these examples.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-225}
\hypertarget{p-5691}{}%
Evaluate%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-293}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-5692}{}%
If we factor the denominator of the integrand, we can see how \(\frac{5x}{x^2-x-2}=\frac{5x}{(x-2)(x+1)}\) might be the sum of two fractions of the form \(\frac{A}{x-2} + \frac{B}{x+1}\), so we suppose that%
\begin{equation}
\frac{5x}{(x-2)(x+1)} = \frac{A}{x-2} + \frac{B}{x+1}\label{E-PF-1}
\end{equation}
and look for the constants \(A\) and \(B\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5693}{}%
Multiplying both sides of this equation by the denominator of the left hand side, \((x-2)(x+1)\), we find that%
\begin{equation*}
5x = A(x+1) + B(x-2)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5694}{}%
To find \(A \) and \(B\), we will rearrange the right hand side of the equation so that similar terms are grouped.%
\begin{align*}
5x&=Ax+ A + Bx -2B \\
5x+0&=(A+B)x + (A-2B) 
\end{align*}
Notice that if this equation is going to hold, then the coefficients for \(x \) on each side of the equation need to match, and we need the constant terms on each side of the equation to match. This gives us the following system of equations:%
\begin{equation*}
5=A+B \, \text{ and } \, 0=A-2B
\end{equation*}
We find that \(A=\frac{10}{3} \) and \(B=\frac{5}{3} \). Thus, using \hyperref[E-PF-1]{Equation~(\ref{E-PF-1})}, we can rewrite the original integral as%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} \, dx = \int \frac{10/3}{x-2} + \frac{5/3}{x+1} \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5695}{}%
This integral can be evaluated by using the fact that \(\int \frac{1}{u} \, du =\ln|u| + C \) and by using substitutions, and hence we find that%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} \, dx = \frac{10}{3} \ln|x-2| + \frac{5}{3}\ln|x+1| + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{example}
\begin{example}[]\label{example-226}
\hypertarget{p-5696}{}%
Evaluate%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{2x^2+5}{x^3-2x^2+x} \, dx \text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-294}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-5697}{}%
If we factor the denominator of the integrand, we can see that \(\frac{2x^2+5}{x^3-2x^2+x} = \frac{2x^2+5}{x(x-1)^2} \). Notice that the factor \((x-1)\) shows up twice in the denominator. We call \((x-1)^2 \) a repeated linear root. The repeated linear root slightly changes our partial fraction decomposition. \(\frac{2x^2+5}{x(x-1)^2} \) can be decomposed into the sum of fractions \(\frac{A}{x}+ \frac{B}{x-1}+\frac{C}{(x-1)^2}\). We need both \(\frac{B}{x-1} \) and \(\frac{C}{(x-1)^2} \) since both \(x-1 \) and \((x-1)^2 \) divide \(x(x-1)^2 \). Suppose%
\begin{equation}
\frac{2x^2+5}{x(x-1)^2}= \frac{A}{x}+ \frac{B}{x-1} + \frac{C}{(x-1)^2} \label{E-PF-2}
\end{equation}
and look for constants \(A \), \(B\), and \(C\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5698}{}%
Multiplying both sides of this equation by the denominator of the left hand side, \(x(x-1)^2 \), we find that%
\begin{equation*}
2x^2+5=A(x-1)^2 + B x (x-1) + Cx 
\end{equation*}
To find \(A \), \(B \), and \(C \), we will rearrange the right hand side of the equation so that similar terms are grouped.%
\begin{align*}
2x^2+5&= A(x^2-2x+1) + B(x^2-x) + Cx \\
2x^2+0x + 5&= (A+B)x^2 + (-2A-B+C)x + A 
\end{align*}
Like the previous example, we need the coefficients for \(x^2 \) to be the same on each side of the equation, the coeffiecients for \(x \) to be the same on each side of the equation, and the constant terms to be the same on each side of the equation. Thus, we obtain the system of equations%
\begin{equation*}
A+B=2 \ , -2A-B+C=0 \ , \text{ and } A=5.
\end{equation*}
We find that \(A=5 \), \(B=-3 \), and \(C=7 \). Thus, using \hyperref[E-PF-2]{Equation~(\ref{E-PF-2})}, we can rewrite the original integral as%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{2x^2+5}{x(x-1)^2} \, dx=\int  \frac{5}{x}- \frac{3}{x-1} + \frac{7}{(x-1)^2} \, dx
\end{equation*}
This integral can be evaluated by using the fact that \(\int \frac{1}{u} \, du =\ln|u|+C\) and by using appropriate substitutions, and hence we find that%
\begin{align*}
\int \frac{2x^2+5}{x(x-1)^2} \, dx&=\int  \frac{5}{x} \, dx - 3 \int \frac{1}{x-1} \, dx + 7 \int (x-2)^{-2} \, dx \\
&=5 \ln|x| -3 \ln|x-1| - 7 (x-1)^{-1} + C 
\end{align*}

The denominator of the integrand is already factored, and the quadratic polynomial \(x^2 + 2x + 3 \) cannot be factored anymore. We call this factor an irreducible quadratic factor. The irreducible quadratic factor slightly changes our partial fraction decomposition. \(\frac{3x^2-1}{(x^2+2x+3)(x-2)} \) can be decomposed into the sum of fractions \(\frac{Ax+B}{x^2+2x+3}+ \frac{C}{x-2}\). We need the term \(\frac{Ax+B}{x^2+2x+3} \) to include all possibilities where the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator. Suppose%
\begin{equation}
\frac{3x^2-1}{(x^2+2x+3)(x-2)}=\frac{Ax+B}{x^2+2x+3}+ \frac{C}{x-2} \label{E-PF-3}
\end{equation}
and look for constants \(A \), \(B\), and \(C\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5701}{}%
Multiplying both sides of this equation by the denominator of the left hand side, \((x^2+2x+3)(x-2) \), we find that%
\begin{equation*}
3x^2-1= (Ax+B)(x-2)+ C(x^2+2x+3) 
\end{equation*}
To find \(A \), \(B \), and \(C \), we will rearrange the right hand side of the equation so that similar terms are grouped.%
\begin{align*}
3x^2-1&= Ax^2-2Ax + Bx -2B + Cx^2 + 2Cx + 3C \\
3x^2+0x-1&= (A+C)x^2 + (-2A+B-2C)x + (-2B+3C) 
\end{align*}
Like the first example, we need the coefficients for \(x^2 \) to be the same on each side of the equation, the coeffiecients for \(x \) to be the same on each side of the equation, and the constant terms to be the same on each side of the equation. Thus, we obtain the system of equations%
\begin{equation*}
A+C=3 \ , -2A+B-2C=0 \ , \text{ and } -2B+3C=-1.
\end{equation*}
We find that \(A=2 \), \(B=2 \), and \(C=1 \). Thus, using \hyperref[E-PF-3]{Equation~(\ref{E-PF-3})}, we can rewrite the original integral as%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{3x^2-1}{(x^2+2x+3)(x-2)} \, dx=\int  \frac{2x+2}{x^2+2x+3}  + \frac{1}{x-2} \, dx
\end{equation*}
This integral can be evaluated by using the fact that \(\int \frac{1}{u} \, du =\ln|u|+C\) and by using appropriate substitutions, and hence we find that%
\begin{align*}
\int \frac{3x^2-1}{(x^2+2x+3)(x-2)} \, dx &= \int \frac{2x+2}{x^2+2x+3} \, dx + \int \frac{1}{x-2} \, dx \\

Before decomposing the integrand into partial fractions, we need to perform polynomial long division because the degree of the numerator, \(3\), is greater than the degree of the denominator, \(2\). We need to do this because partial fraction decompsition leads to a sum of rational functions where the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5704}{}%
After completing polynomial long division, we find that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{-3x^3+9x^2-9x+7}{-x^2+3x-2}
= 3x + \frac{7-3x}{-x^2+3x-2} \, ,
\end{equation*}
hence, we can change the original integral%
\begin{equation}
\int \frac{-3x^3+9x^2-9x+7}{-x^2+3x-2} \, dx
= \int 3x \, dx + \int \frac{7-3x}{-x^2+3x-2} \, dx\label{E-PF-4}
\end{equation}
We'll proceed by using the method of partial fraction decomposition on the integrand \(\frac{7-3x}{-x^2+3x-2} \).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5705}{}%
Notice that the denominator factors as \(-x^2+3x-2= (x-1)(2-x) \), so we'll suppose the integrand decomposes as%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{7-3x}{(x-1)(2-x)}= \frac{A}{x-1}+ \frac{B}{2-x}
\end{equation*}
and we'll look for constants \(A \) and \(B \).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5706}{}%
Multiplying both sides of the equation by the denominator of the left hand side, \((x-1)(2-x)\), we find that%
\begin{equation*}
7-3x = A(2-x) + B(x-1) 
\end{equation*}
To find \(A\) and \(B\), we will rearrange the right hand side of the equation so that similar terms are grouped.%
\begin{align*}
7-3x&=2A-Ax+Bx-B \\
7-3x&=(B-A)x+(2A-B)
\end{align*}
To make sure the coefficients of \(x\) match on each side of the equation and that the constant terms are the same on each side of the equation, we obtain the following system of equations:%
\begin{equation*}
-3=B-A \text{ and } 7=2A-B
\end{equation*}
We find that \(A=4 \) and \(B=1 \). Thus, using \hyperref[E-PF-4]{Equation~(\ref{E-PF-4})}, we can rewrite the original integral as%
\begin{align*}
\int \frac{-3x^3+9x^2-9x+7}{-x^2+3x-2} \, dx
&= \int 3x \, dx + \int \frac{7-3x}{-x^2+3x-2} \, dx \\
&= \int 3x \, dx + \int \frac{4}{x-1} + \frac{1}{2-x} \, dx 
\end{align*}
These integrals can be evaluated by using the antidifferentiation rules from \hyperref[T-4-4-Act2_2]{Table~\ref{T-4-4-Act2_2}} and using appropriate substitutions, and hence we find that%
\begin{align*}
\int \frac{-3x^3+9x^2-9x+7}{-x^2+3x-2} \, dx &= \int 3x \, dx + \int \frac{4}{x-1}\, dx + \int \frac{1}{2-x} \, dx\\
&=\frac{3}{2}x^2 + 4\ln|x-1| - \ln|2-x|+C

These examples have demonstrated how to use the method of partial fraction decomposition in different situations including when the demoninator of a rational function is a product of distinct linear factors, when there is a repeated linear factor in the denominator, when there is an irreducible quadratic factor in the denominator, and when the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator. \begin{assemblage}[Method of Partial Fraction Decomposition for a Rational Function \(R(x)=\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \)]\label{assemblage-118}

If the degree of \(P(x) \) is greater than or equal to the degree \(Q(x) \), then perform polynomial long division to calculate \(\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\), else move on to the next step. The result gives a new way to write \(R(x)\). We know that \(R(x)= S(x)+ \frac{P_2(x)}{Q(x)} \) where \(S(x) \) is the quotient of the polynomial long division and \(P_2 (x) \) is the remainder of the polynomial long division.

The smaller blocks, or partial fraction terms, that \(R(x) \) is broken into often leads to more manageable antidifferentiation. For example if \(A \) and \(k \) are real numbers, then \(\int \frac{A}{x-k} \, dx = A \ln |x-k| + C\) by using the substitution \(u=x-k \).

In the partial fraction section, we saw that this algebraic tool allowed us to break rational functions into manageable chunks, but we didn't yet have the right tool to handle indefinite integrals like \(\int \frac{1}{x^2+4x+13} \, dx\). In \hyperref[E-TS-T4]{Example~\ref{E-TS-T4}}, we will complete the square to algebraically rewrite the integrand as \(\frac{1}{(x+2)^2 + 9} \). Now, the integrand looks similar to the derivative of \(\arctan(x+2) \), but we can see that this is not correct antiderivative since \(\frac{d}{dx} [\arctan(x+2)]=\frac{1}{(x+2)^2+1}\). Using a substitution of a trigonometric function (\(x=\sin(\theta) \), \(x=\tan(\theta)\), and variations thereof) will allow us to leverage the Pythagorean Identity to find these integrals.%

First, let's look at the substitution \(x=\sin(\theta) \) where \(-\frac{\pi}{2}\leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2}\) \footnote{\hyperref[E-TS-1]{Example~\ref{E-TS-1}} will show why we need these bounds on \(\theta \)\label{fn-57}} to see how it can be used to find the indefinite integral \(\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \, dx\). \begin{example}[]\label{E-TS-1}
\hypertarget{p-5739}{}%
Use the substitution \(x=\sin(\theta) \) where \(-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2} \) to find the general antiderivative%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}\, dx.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5740}{}%
When using the substitution \(x=\sin(\theta) \) where \(-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2} \), we are regarding \(x \) as a function of \(\theta \). The goal is to change the integrand to contain trigonometric functions so that the Pythagorean Identity can be used. To do this, the integral will be changed to be in terms of the variable \(\theta\). With this in mind, both \(x \) and \(dx \) will need to be changed. Starting from \(x=\sin(\theta) \), take the derivative with respect to \(\theta \) to find that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dx}{d\theta}=\cos(\theta) .
\end{equation*}
In other words, \(dx=\cos(\theta) \, d\theta \). Now, change the original integral to be in terms of the variable \(\theta \):%
\begin{equation*}
\int\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}\, dx=\int \frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sqrt{1-\sin^2(\theta)}} \, d\theta  
\end{equation*}
Use the Pythagorean Identity, \(1-\sin^2(\theta)=\cos^2(\theta)\) to simplify the denominator of the integrand:%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sqrt{1-\sin^2(\theta)}} \, d\theta = \int\frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sqrt{\cos^2(\theta)}} \, d \theta.
\end{equation*}
Now we need to use the assumption that \(-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2}\). In general, \(\sqrt{\cos^2(\theta)}=|\cos(\theta)|\), but \(\cos(\theta)\geq 0\) on the interval \(-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2}\). Thus, \(|\cos(\theta)|=\cos(\theta)\) if \(-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2} \). The denominator can now be further simplified, and the remaining steps lead to a familar integral:%
\begin{align*}
\int\frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sqrt{\cos^2(\theta)}} \, d\theta \amp = \int\frac{\cos(\theta)}{|\cos(\theta)|} \, d\theta \\
\amp =\int\frac{\cos(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} \, d\theta \\
\amp =\int 1 \, d\theta \\
\amp =\theta + C
\end{align*}
While we have computed an antiderivative successfully, we aren't quite done yet because the answer is not written in terms of the original variable \(x \). Rearrange the substitution equation \(x=\sin(\theta) \) to find that \(\theta=\arcsin(x) \) and use this to turn \(\theta\) back into a function of \(x \). Therefore,%
\begin{equation*}
\int\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \, dx= \arcsin(x) + C 
\end{equation*}
%
\end{example}
 From now on, we'll usually omit the explanation that \(\sqrt{\cos^2(\theta)}=|\cos(\theta)|=\cos(\theta)\) since we additionally assume that \(-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2} \) in order to force \(\cos(\theta) \geq 0 \). It is still incredibly important so that the calculation of the antiderivative is seamless, but since we always assume that \(-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2} \) the same reasoning always applies.%

The style of substitution that was demonstrated in the previous example can be extended to help find more algebraic antiderivatives especially when the integrand contains \(a^2-u^2 \) where \(a \) is a real number and \(u \) is a variable and other methods like \(u\)-substitution and partial fractions have failed. The changes that will be made to the substitution are necessary so that the Pythagorean Identity can still be applied.

Compared to the first example, where the substitution \(x=\sin(\theta) \) worked, we'll need to make two adjustments so that we can still use Pythagoren's Identity. Since \(\sqrt{9-4x^2}=\sqrt{9-(2x)^2}\), we'll want to substitute \(2x=3\sin(\theta) \) so that we can factor out the 9 and obtain the expression \(1-\sin^2(\theta) \). Assuming \(2x=3\sin(\theta) \) then \((2x)^2=9 \sin^2(\theta)\) and \(2 dx=3 \cos(\theta)d\theta\).%
\begin{align*}
\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{9-4x^2}} \, dx \amp = \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{9-(2x)^2}} \, dx\\
\amp = \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{9-(2x)^2}} \, dx\\
\amp = \int \frac{(3/2)\cos(\theta)}{\sqrt{9-9\sin^2(\theta)}} \, d\theta\\
\amp = \frac{3}{2}\int \frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sqrt{9(1-\sin^2(\theta))}} \, d\theta\\
\amp = \frac{3}{2}\int \frac{\cos(\theta)}{3\sqrt{\cos^2(\theta)}} \, d\theta\\

\amp = \frac{3}{6}\int 1 \, d\theta\\
\amp = \frac{1}{2}\theta+ C \

We can solve for \(\theta \) in our substitution equation to find that the antiderivative is:%

Use the substitution \(x=3\sin(\theta) \). Then \(x^2=9\sin^2(\theta)\) and \(dx=3\cos(\theta) d\theta\). As stated in the hint, we'll use that \((9-x^2)^{3/2}=((9-x^2)^{1/2})^3\) and simplify the inner most set of parentheses before cubing.%
\begin{align*}
\int \frac{9}{(9-x^2)^{3/2}} \, dx \amp = \int \frac{9\cdot 3\cos(\theta)}{(9-9\sin^2(\theta))^{3/2}} \, d\theta \\
\amp = 27\int \frac{\cos(\theta)}{(9(1-\sin^2(\theta)))^{3/2}} \, d\theta \\
\amp = 27\int \frac{\cos(\theta)}{9^{3/2}((1-\sin^2(\theta))^{1/2})^3} \, d\theta \\
\amp = \frac{27}{27}\int \frac{\cos(\theta)}{((\cos^2(\theta))^{1/2})^3} \, d\theta \\
\amp =\int \frac{\cos(\theta)}{(\cos(\theta))^3} \, d\theta \\
\amp =\int \frac{1}{\cos^2(\theta)} \, d\theta \\
\amp = \tan(\theta) + C
\end{align*}
When we solve for \(\theta \) and replace it with a function of \(x \), we obtain%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{9}{(9-x^2)^{3/2}} \, dx = \tan(\arcsin(x/3)) + C \text{.}
\end{equation*}
In other words, the general antiderivative is ``the tangent of the angle whose sine is \(\frac{x}{3} \)''. To simplify this expression, we can look at a right triangle that has \(\theta \) as one of its angles and use some trigonometry. Since \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{3} \), we'll assume that the hypotenuse has length 3 and the side opposite the angle \(\theta \) has length \(x \). The missing side length is found by using Pythagorean's Theorem. Then using this right triangle, we find that \(\tan(\theta)=\frac{x}{\sqrt{9-x^2}} \). Therefore,%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{9}{(9-x^2)^{3/2}} \, dx = \frac{x}{\sqrt{9-x^2}} + C

\begin{assemblage}[Trigonometric Substitution: \(u=a\sin(\theta) \)]\label{assemblage-120}

The substitution \(u=a\sin(\theta) \) where \(u \) is some function of \(x \), \(a \) is a real number, and \(-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2} \) is often helpful when the integrand contains an expression of the form \(a^2-u^2 \). When this substitution is used, then \(u^2=a^2\sin^2(\theta)\) and after factoring out \(a^2 \), the Pythagorean Identity \footnote{\(1-\sin^2(\theta)=\cos^2(\theta) \)\label{fn-58}} can be used to simplify part of the integrand:%
\begin{equation*}
a^2-u^2=a^2-a^2\sin^2(\theta)=a^2(1-\sin^2(\theta))=a^2\cos^2(\theta) \text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5761}{}%
Since we assumed \(-\frac{\pi}{2} \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2} \), then \(\cos (\theta) \geq 0 \). This implies that \(\sqrt{\cos^2(\theta)}=|\cos(\theta)|=\cos(\theta) \).%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-5762}{}%
Another important trigonometric substitution is \(x=\tan(\theta) \) where \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\) \footnote{Example TBA shows why we need these assumptions\label{fn-59}}. This substitution can be used to show that \(\int \frac{1}{1+x^2} \, dx= \arctan(x) + C \). \begin{example}[]\label{E-TS-T1}

\par
\hypertarget{p-5764}{}%
When using the substitution \(x=\tan(\theta) \) where \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2} \), we are regarding \(x \) as a function of \(\theta \). The goal is to change the integrand to contain trigonometric functions so that a modified version of the Pythagorean Identity can be used. The version of the Pythagorean Identity we will use when simplifying after a tangent substitution is \(\tan^2(\theta) + 1 =\sec^2(\theta) \). To achieve this goal, the integral will be changed to be in terms of the variable \(\theta\). With this in mind, both \(x \) and \(dx \) will need to be changed. Starting from \(x=\tan(\theta) \), take the derivative with respect to \(\theta \) to find that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dx}{d\theta}=\sec^2(\theta) .
\end{equation*}
In other words, \(dx=\sec^2(\theta) \, d\theta \). Now, change the original integral to be in terms of the variable \(\theta \):%
\begin{equation*}
\int\frac{1}{1+x^2}\, dx=\int \frac{\sec^2(\theta)}{1+\tan^2(\theta)} \, d\theta  
\end{equation*}
Use a modified version of the Pythagorean Identity, \(1+\tan^2(\theta)=\sec^2(\theta)\) to simplify the denominator of the integrand:%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{\sec^2(\theta)}{1+\tan^2(\theta)} \, d\theta = \int\frac{\sec^2(\theta)}{\sec^2(\theta)} \, d \theta.
\end{equation*}
The integrand can now be further simplified, and the remaining steps lead to a familar antiderivative:%
\begin{align*}
\int\frac{\sec^2(\theta)}{\sec^2(\theta)} \, d \theta&= \int 1 \, d \theta\\
&=\theta + C
\end{align*}
While we have computed an antiderivative successfully, we aren't quite done yet because the answer is not written in terms of the original variable \(x \). Rearrange the substitution equation \(x=\tan(\theta) \) to find that \(\theta=\arctan(x) \) and use this to turn \(\theta\) back into a function of \(x \). Therefore,%
\begin{equation*}
\int\frac{1}{1+x^2} \, dx= \arctan(x) + C 
\end{equation*}
%
\end{example}
 The style of substitution that was demonstrated in the previous example can be extended to help find more algebraic antiderivatives especially when the integrand contains \(a^2+u^2 \) where \(a \) is a real number and \(u \) is a variable. The changes that will be made to the substitution are necessary so that a modified the Pythagorean Identity can still be applied. The following examples will explore exactly what alterations should be made to the substitution \(x=\tan(\theta)\). \begin{example}[]\label{E-TS-T2}

Now, we can use a substitution and the antidifferentiation rule \(\int \frac{1}{1+u^2} \, du=\arctan(u) + C \). Let \(u=\frac{x}{4}\), then \(du=\frac{dx}{4} \) and \(4 du=dx\).%

%
 \hypertarget{p-5776}{}%
The expression \(25 + 9x^2 \) can be rewritten as \(5^2+(3x)^2\) so that it looks like \(u^2+a^2\). The substitution \(3x=5\tan(\theta) \) will allow us to use the modified Pythagorean Identity. Then \((3x)^2=25\tan^2(\theta)\) and \(dx=\frac{5}{3} \sec^2(\theta) d\theta \). The original integral can be transformed using this substitution:%
\begin{align*}
\int \frac{3x}{\sqrt{25+9x^2}} \, dx &= \frac{5}{3}\int \frac{5\tan(\theta)\sec^2(\theta)}{\sqrt{25+25\tan^2(\theta)}} \, d\theta \\
&= \frac{25}{3}\int \frac{\tan(\theta)\sec^2(\theta)}{\sqrt{25(1+\tan^2(\theta)}} \, d\theta \\
&= \frac{25}{3}\int \frac{\tan(\theta)\sec^2(\theta)}{\sqrt{25\sec^2(\theta)}} \, d\theta \\
&= \frac{25}{3}\int \frac{\tan(\theta)\sec^2(\theta)}{\sqrt{25}\sqrt{\sec^2(\theta)}} \, d\theta 
\end{align*}
We must be careful at this step when we simplify \(\sqrt{\sec^2(\theta)}\). Because we chose \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2} \), then \(\sec^2(\theta) \geq 1 \geq 0 \). Notice that if we had picked a different interval for \(\theta \), \(\sec(\theta) \) could be negative and then we would have to introduce an absolute value in order for the square root to be defined. Since we know \(\sec^2(\theta) \geq 1\geq 0\) on the interval of \(\theta\) we care about then \(\sqrt{\sec^2(\theta)}=\sec(\theta)\). Therefore, the integral simplifies further:%
\begin{align*}
\frac{25}{3}\int \frac{\tan(\theta)\sec^2(\theta)}{\sqrt{25}\sqrt{\sec^2(\theta)}} \, d\theta &= \frac{5}{3} \int \frac{\tan(\theta) \sec^2(\theta) }{\sec(\theta)} \, d \theta \\
&= \frac{5}{3} \int \tan(\theta)\sec(\theta) \, d \theta \\
&=\frac{5}{3} \sec(\theta) + C \\
&= \frac{5}{3} \sec\left(\arctan\left(\frac{3x}{5} \right)\right) + C 
\end{align*}
This answer can be simplified to a more recognizable form by using a right triangle with angle \(\theta \) and \(\tan(\theta)=\frac{3x}{5} \), and finding \(\sec(\theta) \) by using the triangle. \begin{figure}

a^2+u^2=a^2+a^2\tan^2(\theta)=a^2(1+\tan^2(\theta))=a^2\sec^2(\theta) \text{.}

Use the substitution \(3x=\tan(\theta) \), so \((3x)^2=9x^2=\tan^2(\theta) \) and \(3dx=\sec^2(\theta)d\theta \). We can transform the orignal integral using this substitution:%
\begin{align*}

To find the antiderivative in terms of \(x\), consider a right triangle with angle \(\theta\) and \(\tan(\theta)=3x\). \begin{figure}

Use a right triangle with one angle measuring \(\theta \) and with \(\sin(\theta)=\frac{x}{\sqrt{5}} \) to find the antiderivative with respect to \(x \). \begin{figure}

\begin{equation*}
\int\frac{\sqrt{25-9x^2}}{9x^2} \, dx= -\frac{\sqrt{25-9x^2}}{9x} -\frac{1}{3}\arcsin\left(\frac{3x}{5} \right) + C

&=\int \frac{2u}{u^2+9} \, du + \int \frac{4}{u^2+9} \, du  
\end{align*}
To integrate \(\int \frac{2u}{u^2+9} \, du\), use the substitution \(w=u^2+9 \) and \(dw= 2u \, du\). Thus,%
\begin{align*}
\int \frac{2u}{u^2+9} \, du&=\int \frac{1}{w} \, dw\\
&=\ln|w| + C_1\\
&=\ln|(x+3)^2 + 9| + C_1 
\end{align*}
To integrate \(\int \frac{4}{u^2+9} \, du \), we can use a trigonometric substitution or we can factor out the 9, use the substitution \(v=w/3 \text{ and }dv=dw/3\) and use the antidifferentiation rule \(\int\frac{1}{1+u^2} \, du=\arctan(u) + C\). The latter method will be shown:%
\begin{align*}
\int \frac{4}{u^2+9} \, du &=\frac{4}{9} \int \frac{1}{(u/3)^2 + 1} \, du\\
&=\frac{4}{3} \int \frac{1}{v^2 + 1} \, dv\\
&=\frac{4}{3} \arctan(v) + C_2 \\
&=\frac{4}{3} \arctan\left(\frac{x+3}{3}\right) + C_2 
\end{align*}
Therefore,%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{2x+7}{x^2+6x+18} \, dx= \ln|(x+3)^2 + 9|  + \frac{4}{3} \arctan\left(\frac{x+3}{3}\right) + C

What role can a computer algebra system play in the process of finding antiderivatives?%
\end{itemize}
\end{objectives}
\hypertarget{p-5819}{}%
We have learned several antidifferentiation techniques: \(u\)-substitution, integration by parts, trigonometric substitution, and the method of partial fractions. However, there will still be cases of integrals that can not be solved by these methods. Consider the integral \(\int e^{x^2} \, dx\): none of these methods can be used to solve this integral. In fact, an elementary algebraic antiderivative for \(e^{x^2}\) does not exist. No antidifferentiation method will provide us with a simple algebraic formula for a function \(F(x)\) that satisfies \(F'(x) = e^{x^2}\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5820}{}%
The goal of this section is to recognize that there are many functions for which an algebraic formula for an antiderivative does not exist, and appreciate the role that computing technology can play in finding antiderivatives of other complicated functions. Moreover, tables of integrals can be helpful in finding antiderivatives quickly, even when we are able to compute them by hand.%
\begin{example}[]\label{PA-5-5}
\hypertarget{p-5821}{}%
For each of the indefinite integrals below, look at the table of integrals in \hyperref[integral-table]{Appendix~\ref{integral-table}} and decide how an antiderivative may be obtained using the table. It is also worthwhile to ask whether any of the methods we have learned so far can also be used to find an antiderivative. \leavevmode%

\subsection[{Using an Integral Table}]{Using an Integral Table}\label{subsection-147}
\hypertarget{p-5831}{}%
Calculus has a long history, going back to Greek mathematicians in 400-300 BC. Its main foundations were first investigated and understood independently by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the late 1600s, making the modern ideas of calculus well over 300 years old. It is instructive to realize that until the late 1980s, the personal computer did not exist, so calculus (and other mathematics) had to be done by hand for roughly 300 years. In the 21st century, however, computers have revolutionized many aspects of the world we live in, including mathematics. In this section we take a short historical tour to precede discussing the role computer algebra systems can play in evaluating indefinite integrals. In particular, we consider a class of integrals involving certain radical expressions.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5832}{}%
As seen in the short table of integrals found in \hyperref[integral-table]{Appendix~\ref{integral-table}}, there are many forms of integrals that involve \(\sqrt{a^2 \pm w^2}\) and \(\sqrt{w^2 - a^2}\). These integral rules can be developed using the technique known as \emph{trigonometric substitution} that we learned in the last section. To see how these rules are used, consider the differences among%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \,dx, \ \ \  \int \frac{x}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \,dx, \ \ \  \text{and}  \ \ \ \int \sqrt{1-x^2} \,dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5833}{}%
The first integral is a familiar basic one, and results in \(\arcsin(x) + C\). The second integral can be evaluated using a standard \(u\)-substitution with \(u = 1-x^2\). The third, however, is not familiar and does not lend itself to \(u\)-substitution.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5834}{}%
In \hyperref[integral-table]{Appendix~\ref{integral-table}}, we find the rule%
\begin{equation*}
\text{(h)} ~  \int \sqrt{a^2 - u^2} \, du = \frac{u}{2}\sqrt{a^2 - u^2} + \frac{a^2}{2} \arcsin \frac{u}{a} + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5835}{}%
Using the substitutions \(a = 1\) and \(u = x\) (so that \(du = dx\)), it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
\int \sqrt{1-x^2} \, dx = \frac{x}{2} \sqrt{1-x^2} + \frac{1}{2} \arcsin x + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5836}{}%
Whenever we are applying a rule in the table, we are doing a \(u\)-substitution, particularly when the substitution is more complicated than setting \(u = x\) as in the last example.%
\begin{example}[]\label{ex-5-5-table-c}
\hypertarget{p-5837}{}%
Evaluate the integral%
\begin{equation*}
\int \sqrt{9 + 64x^2} \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-312}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-5838}{}%
Here, we want to use Rule (c) from the table, but we now set \(a = 3\) and \(u = 8x\). We also choose the ``\(+\)'' option in the rule. With this substitution, it follows that \(du = 8dx\), so \(dx = \frac{1}{8} du\). Applying the substitution,%
\begin{equation*}
\int \sqrt{9 + 64x^2} \, dx = \int \sqrt{9 + u^2} \cdot \frac{1}{8} \, du = \frac{1}{8} \int \sqrt{9+u^2} \, du\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5839}{}%
By Rule (c), we now find that%
\begin{align*}
\int \sqrt{9 + 64x^2} \, dx =\mathstrut \amp  \frac{1}{8} \left( \frac{u}{2}\sqrt{u^2 + 9} + \frac{9}{2}\ln\left|u + \sqrt{u^2 + 9}\right| + C \right)\\
=\mathstrut \amp  \frac{1}{8} \left( \frac{8x}{2}\sqrt{64x^2 + 9} + \frac{9}{2}\ln\left|8x + \sqrt{64x^2 + 9}\right| + C \right)\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-5840}{}%
Whenever we use a \(u\)-subsitution in conjunction with \hyperref[integral-table]{Appendix~\ref{integral-table}}, it's important that we not forget to address any constants that arise and include them in our computations, such as the \(\frac{1}{8}\) that appeared in \hyperref[ex-5-5-table-c]{Example~\ref{ex-5-5-table-c}}.%

By Rule (c) in \hyperref[integral-table]{Appendix~\ref{integral-table}} with \(a=2\) and \(u = x\),%
\begin{equation*}
\int \sqrt{x^2 + 4} \, dx = \frac{x}2\sqrt{x^2+4}+\frac42\ln\left|x+\sqrt{x^2+4}\right|+C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-3769}{}\hypertarget{p-5858}{}%
Let \(u=x^2 + 4\), so \(du = 2x\, dx\). Thus%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 +4}} \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \int \frac{du}{\sqrt{u}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2u^{1/2} + C = \sqrt{x^2 + 4} + C\text{.}

%

Letting \(a = 4\) and \(u = 5x\), we see \(du=5\,dx\). Thus,%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{2}{\sqrt{16+25x^2}}\, dx = \frac{2}{5} \int \frac{du}{\sqrt{a^2 + u^2}}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Now by Rule (b) in \hyperref[integral-table]{Appendix~\ref{integral-table}}, it follows%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{2}{\sqrt{16+25x^2}}\, dx = \frac{2}{5} \ln\left| 5x + \sqrt{16+25x^2} \right| + C\text{.}

%

Letting \(a = 7\) and \(u = 6x\), it follows that \(x=\frac{1}{6}u\) and \(du=6\,dx\), and therefore%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{1}{x^2 \sqrt{49-36x^2}} \, dx = \frac{1}{6} \int \frac{1}{\frac{1}{36}u^2 \sqrt{a^2-u^2}} \, du\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Using Rule (k) in \hyperref[integral-table]{Appendix~\ref{integral-table}} and the fact that \(\frac{1}{6} \cdot 36 = 6\), we see%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{1}{x^2 \sqrt{49-36x^2}} \, dx = -6\cdot \frac{\sqrt{49-36x^2}}{49 \cdot 6x} + C\text{.}

\subsection[{Using Computer Algebra Systems}]{Using Computer Algebra Systems}\label{subsection-148}
\hypertarget{p-5861}{}%
A computer algebra system (CAS) is a computer program that is capable of executing symbolic mathematics. For example, if we ask a CAS to solve the equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) for the variable \(x\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are arbitrary constants, the program will return \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\). Research to develop the first CAS dates to the 1960s, and these programs became publicly available in the early 1990s. Two prominent examples are the programs \emph{Maple} and \emph{Mathematica}, which were among the first computer algebra systems to offer a graphical user interface. Today, \emph{Maple} and \emph{Mathematica} are exceptionally powerful professional software packages that can execute an amazing array of sophisticated mathematical computations. They are also very expensive, as each is a proprietary program. The CAS \emph{SAGE} is an open-source, free alternative to \emph{Maple} and \emph{Mathematica}.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5862}{}%
For the purposes of this text, when we need to use a CAS, we are going to turn instead to a similar, but somewhat different computational tool, the web-based ``computational knowledge engine'' called \emph{WolframAlpha}.\footnote{\emph{WolframAlpha} can be accessed at \href{https://www.wolframalpha.com/}{www.wolframalpha.com}.\label{fn-62}} There are two features of \emph{WolframAlpha} that make it stand out from the CAS options mentioned above: (1) unlike \emph{Maple} and \emph{Mathematica}, \emph{WolframAlpha} is free (provided we are willing to navigate some pop-up advertising); and (2) unlike any of the three, the syntax in \emph{WolframAlpha} is flexible. Think of \emph{WolframAlpha} as being a little bit like doing a Google search: the program will interpret what is input, and then provide a summary of options.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5863}{}%
If we want to have \emph{WolframAlpha} evaluate an integral for us, we can provide it syntax such as%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-4}{}
\hypertarget{p-5864}{}%
\mono{integrate x\textasciicircum{}2 dx}%
\end{quote}
\hypertarget{p-5865}{}%
to which the program responds with%
\begin{equation*}
\int x^2 \, dx = \frac{x^3}{3} + \text{constant}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5866}{}%
To find the partial fraction decomposition of any rational function, in \emph{WolframAlpha}, entering%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-5}{}
\hypertarget{p-5867}{}%
\mono{partial fraction 5x/(x\textasciicircum{}2-x-2)}%
\end{quote}
\hypertarget{p-5868}{}%
results in the output%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{5x}{x^2-x-2} = \frac{10}{3(x-2)} + \frac{5}{3(x+1)}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5869}{}%
While there is much to be enthusiastic about regarding CAS programs such as \emph{WolframAlpha}, there are several things we should be cautious about: (1) a CAS only responds to exactly what is input; (2) a CAS can answer using powerful functions from very advanced mathematics; and (3) there are problems that even a CAS cannot do without additional human insight.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5870}{}%
Although (1) likely goes without saying, we have to be careful with our input: if we enter syntax that defines the wrong function, the CAS will work with precisely the function we define. For example, if we are interested in evaluating the integral%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{1}{16-5x^2} \, dx\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and we mistakenly enter%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-6}{}
\hypertarget{p-5871}{}%
\mono{integrate 1/16 - 5x\textasciicircum{}2 dx}%
\end{quote}
\hypertarget{p-5872}{}%
a CAS will (correctly) reply with%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{16}x - \frac{5}{3} x^3\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5873}{}%
But if we are sufficiently well-versed in antidifferentiation, we will recognize that this function cannot be the one that we seek: integrating a rational function such as \(\frac{1}{16-5x^2}\), we expect the logarithm function to be present in the result.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5874}{}%
Regarding (2), even for a relatively simple integral such as \(\int \frac{1}{16-5x^2} \, dx\), some CASs will invoke advanced functions rather than simple ones. For instance, if we use \emph{Maple} to execute the command%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-7}{}
\hypertarget{p-5875}{}%
\mono{int(1/(16-5*x\textasciicircum{}2), x);}%
\end{quote}
\hypertarget{p-5876}{}%
the program responds with%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{1}{16-5x^2} \, dx = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{20} \arctanh  \left(\frac{\sqrt{5}}{4}x\right)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5877}{}%
While this is correct (save for the missing arbitrary constant, which \emph{Maple} never reports), the inverse hyperbolic tangent function is not a common nor familiar one; a simpler way to express this function can be found by using the partial fractions method, and happens to be the result reported by \emph{WolframAlpha}:%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{1}{16-5x^2} \, dx = \frac{1}{8\sqrt{5}} \left(\log(4\sqrt{5}+5x) - \log(4\sqrt{5}-5x)\right) + \text{constant}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5878}{}%
Using sophisticated functions from more advanced mathematics is sometimes the way a CAS says to the user ``I don't know how to do this problem.'' For example, if we want to evaluate%
\begin{equation*}
\int e^{-x^2} \, dx\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and we ask \emph{WolframAlpha} to do so, the input%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-8}{}
\hypertarget{p-5879}{}%
\mono{integrate exp(-x\textasciicircum{}2) dx}%
\end{quote}
\hypertarget{p-5880}{}%
results in the output%
\begin{equation*}
\int e^{-x^2} \, dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}\erf  (x) + \text{constant}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5881}{}%
The function ``erf\((x)\)'' is the \emph{error function}, \index{error function} which is actually defined by an integral:%
\begin{equation*}
\erf  (x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_0^x e^{-t^2} \, dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5882}{}%
So, in producing an output involving an integral, the CAS has basically reported back to us the very question we asked.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5883}{}%
Finally, as remarked at (3) above, there are times that a CAS will actually fail without some additional human insight. If we consider the integral%
\begin{equation*}
\int (1+x)e^x \sqrt{1+x^2e^{2x}} \, dx
\end{equation*}
and ask \emph{WolframAlpha} to evaluate%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-9}{}
\hypertarget{p-5884}{}%
\mono{int (1+x) * exp(x) * sqrt(1+x\textasciicircum{}2 * exp(2x)) dx},%
\end{quote}
\hypertarget{p-5885}{}%
the program thinks for a moment and then reports%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-10}{}
\hypertarget{p-5886}{}%
(\emph{no result found in terms of standard mathematical functions})%
\end{quote}
\hypertarget{p-5887}{}%
But in fact this integral is not that difficult to evaluate. If we let \(u = xe^{x}\), then \(du = (1+x)e^x \, dx\), which means that the preceding integral has the form%
\begin{equation*}
\int (1+x)e^x \sqrt{1+x^2e^{2x}} \, dx = \int \sqrt{1+u^2} \, du\text{,}
\end{equation*}
which is a straightforward one for any CAS to evaluate.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5888}{}%
So, we should proceed with some caution: while any CAS is capable of evaluating a wide range of integrals (both definite and indefinite), there are times when the result can mislead us. We must think carefully about the meaning of the output, whether it is consistent with what we expect, and whether or not it makes sense to proceed.%

Until the development of computer algebra systems, integral tables enabled students of calculus to evaluate integrals of certain forms quickly, such as \(\int \sqrt{a^2 + u^2} \, du\), where \(a\) is a positive real number. A short table of integrals may be found in \hyperref[integral-table]{Appendix~\ref{integral-table}}.%

Computer algebra systems can play an important role in finding antiderivatives, though we must be cautious to use correct input, to watch for unusual or unfamiliar advanced functions that the CAS may cite in its result, and to consider the possibility that a CAS may need further assistance or insight from us in order to answer a particular question.%

Wolfram|Alpha shows that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{x^3 + x + 1}{x^4 - 1} = -\frac{1}{2(x^2+1)} + \frac{1}{4(x+1)} + \frac{3}{4(x-1)}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Then, using standard antiderivatives,%
\begin{align*}
\int \frac{x^3 + x + 1}{x^4 - 1} \, dx &= \int -\frac{1}{2(x^2+1)} + \frac{1}{4(x+1)} + \frac{3}{4(x-1)} \ dx\\
&= \int -\frac{1}{2(x^2+1)} \ dx + \int \frac{1}{4(x+1)} \ dx + int \frac{3}{4(x-1)} \ dx\\
&= -\frac{1}{2} \arctan(x) + \frac{1}{4} \ln|x+1| + \frac{3}{4} \ln|x-1| + C
\end{align*}
Directly asking Wolfram|Alpha to integrate \(\frac{x^3 + x + 1}{x^4 - 1}\) yields%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{x^3 + x + 1}{x^4 - 1} \, dx = \frac{1}{4} \left( 3\log(1-x) + \log(x+1) - 2\arctan{x} \right) + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
By rearranging, distributing the \(\frac{1}{4}\), and noticing that Wolfram|Alpha does not use absolute value with integrals involving the logarithm (as well as that \(|x-1| = |1-x|\)), we see that these two results are the same.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3778}{}\hypertarget{p-5899}{}%
Wolfram|Alpha shows that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{x^5 + x^2 + 3}{x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6} = x^2 + 6x + 25 + \frac{255}{2(x-3)} - \frac{39}{x-2} + \frac{5}{2(x-1)}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Then, using standard antiderivatives,%
\begin{align*}
\int \frac{x^5 + x^2 + 3}{x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6} \, dx &= \int x^2 + 6x + 25 + \frac{255}{2(x-3)} - \frac{39}{x-2} + \frac{5}{2(x-1)} \ dx\\
&= \int x^2 \ dx + \int 6x \ dx + \int 25 \ dx + \int \frac{255}{2(x-3)} \ dx - \int \frac{39}{x-2} \ dx + \int \frac{5}{2(x-1)} \ dx\\
&= \frac{x^3}{3} + 3x^2 + 25x + \frac{255}{2} \ln|x-3| - 39 \ln|x-2| + \frac{5}{2} \ln|x-1| + C\text{.}
\end{align*}
Directly asking Wolfram|Alpha to integrate \(\frac{x^5 + x^2 + 3}{x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6}\) yields the same result with the caveats mentioned in part (a).%
\item\hypertarget{li-3779}{}\hypertarget{p-5900}{}%
Wolfram|Alpha shows that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{x^2 - x - 1}{(x-3)^3} = \frac{1}{x-3} + \frac{5}{(x-3)^2} + \frac{5}{(x-3)^3}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Then, using standard antiderivatives,%
\begin{align*}
\int \frac{x^2 - x - 1}{(x-3)^3} \, dx &= \int \frac{1}{x-3} + \frac{5}{(x-3)^2} + \frac{5}{(x-3)^3} \ dx\\
&= \int \frac{1}{x-3} \ dx + \int \frac{5}{(x-3)^2} \ dx + \int \frac{5}{(x-3)^3} \ dx\\
&= \ln|x-3| + \int 5(x-3)^{-2} \ dx + \int 5(x-3)^{-3} \ dx\\
&= \ln|x-3| - \frac{5}{x-3} - \frac{5}{2(x-3)^2} + C\text{.}
\end{align*}
Directly asking Wolfram|Alpha to integrate \(\frac{x^2 - x - 1}{(x-3)^3}\) yields%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{x^2 - x - 1}{(x-3)^3} \, dx = \log(x-3) - \frac{5(2x-5)}{2(x-3)^2} + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
The logarithm part is the same, and since%
\begin{equation*}
-\frac{5}{x-3} - \frac{5}{2(x-3)^2}  = -\frac{5[2(x-3) + 1]}{2(x-3)^2} = -\frac{5(2x-5)}{2(x-3)^2}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
we see that the rest of the result matches as well.%

\item\hypertarget{li-3788}{}\hypertarget{p-5912}{}%
For \(\int \frac{1}{x \sqrt{9x^2 + 25}} \, dx\), we let \(u = 3x\) so \(du = 3 \, dx\) and \(x = \frac{1}{3} u\). Applying this substitution,%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{1}{x \sqrt{9x^2 + 25}} \, dx = \int \frac{3}{u \sqrt{u^2 + 25}} \cdot \frac{1}{3} \, du = \int \frac{1}{u \sqrt{u^2 + 25}} \, du\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Now, using Rule (e) from the appendix with \(a = 5\),%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{1}{u \sqrt{u^2 + 25}} \, du = -\frac{1}{5} \ln \left| \frac{5+\sqrt{u^2 + 5^2}}{u} \right| + C
\end{equation*}
Substituting back to \(x\), we've shown that%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{1}{x \sqrt{9x^2 + 25}} \, dx = -\frac{1}{5} \ln \left| \frac{5+\sqrt{9x^2 + 5^2}}{3x} \right| + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Asking Wolfram|Alpha to evaluate the same original integral, the program reports that%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{1}{x \sqrt{9x^2 + 25}} \, dx = \frac{1}{5} \left( \log(x) - \log\left( \sqrt{9x^2 + 25} + 5\right) \right) + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
These two results are in fact the same (the program uses ``\(\log\)'' where we use ``\(\ln\)''), though it takes some work with logarithm properties to show this. Using the rule \(\ln(\frac{u}{v}) = \ln (u) - \ln (v)\) and \(\ln(3x) = \ln(3) + \ln(x)\) and including the value \(\ln(3)\) in the arbitrary constant of integration, it follows that the two results match.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3789}{}\hypertarget{p-5913}{}%
For \(\int x \sqrt{1 + x^4} \, dx\), we first recognize that \(x^4 = (x^2)^2\), and that with \(u = x^2\) we have a function-derivative pair present with \(du = 2x \, dx\). Applying this substitution,%
\begin{equation*}
\int x \sqrt{1 + x^4} \, dx = \int \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{1+u^2} \, du\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Next, we use Rule (c) with ``\(+\)'' and \(a = 1\) to find that%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{1+u^2} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{u}{2}\sqrt{u^2 + 1} + \frac{1}{2}\ln|u + \sqrt{u^2 + 1}| \right) + C
\end{equation*}
Returning to the original variable, \(x\), we have%
\begin{equation*}
\int x \sqrt{1 + x^4} \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x^2}{2}\sqrt{x^4 + 1} + \frac{1}{2}\ln|x^2 + \sqrt{x^4 + 1}| \right) + C
\end{equation*}
Wolfram|Alpha's first response when asked to evaluate this integral is to give a result that involves the hyperbolic sine function (\(\sinh^{-1}(x^2)\)); if we scroll down to ``alternate results'', we find one that matches what we've found above.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3790}{}\hypertarget{p-5914}{}%
For \(\int e^x \sqrt{4 + e^{2x}} \, dx\), we first observe that \(e^{2x} = (e^x)^2\). If we use the substitution \(u = e^x\), the resulting integral is%
\begin{equation*}
\int e^x \sqrt{4 + e^{2x}} \, dx = \int \sqrt{4 + u^2} \, du\text{,}
\end{equation*}
which can be evaluated by the same approach as in part (b) with Rule (c) from the Appendix, this time with \(a = 2\). Thus,%
\begin{equation*}
\int \sqrt{4 + u^2} \, du = \frac{u}{2}\sqrt{u^2 + 4} + \frac{2^2}{2}\ln|u + \sqrt{u^2 + 4}|
\end{equation*}
Substituting back,%
\begin{equation*}
\int e^x \sqrt{4 + e^{2x}} \, dx = \frac{e^x}{2}\sqrt{e^{2x} + 4} + 2\ln|e^x + \sqrt{e^{2x} + 4}|  + C
\end{equation*}
As in part (b), we need to scroll down in Wolfram|Alpha's results to find one close to what we have here. The alternate result almost matches, but the program writes%
\begin{equation*}
\log(\left( \sqrt{\frac{e^{2x}}{4} + 1 } + \frac{e^{x}}{2} \right)
\end{equation*}
where we have%
\begin{equation*}
\ln|e^x + \sqrt{e^{2x} + 4}.|
\end{equation*}
This discrepancy can be explained using properties of the logarithm function and the presence of the arbitrary constant. If we write%
\begin{equation*}
\log(\left( \sqrt{\frac{e^{2x}}{4} + 1 } + \frac{e^{x}}{2} \right) = \log(\left( \sqrt{\frac{e^{2x} + 4}{4}} + \frac{e^{x}}{2} \right) = \log(\left( \frac{ \sqrt{e^{2x} + 4} + e^{x}}{2} \right)
\end{equation*}
and then recall that \(\log \left( \frac{z}{2} \right) = \log(z) - \log(2)\), we see that the \(\log(2)\) can be included in the arbitray constant, and the two different results actually match.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3791}{}\hypertarget{p-5915}{}%
To evaluate the integral \(\int \frac{\tan(x)}{\sqrt{9 - \cos^2(x)}} \, dx\), we first write \(\tan(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}\) to have the integral in the form%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{\tan(x)}{\sqrt{9 - \cos^2(x)}} \, dx = \int \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x) \sqrt{9 - \cos^2(x)}} \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Next, letting \(u = \cos(x)\), it follows \(du = -\sin(x) \, dx\), and therefore%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{\tan(x)}{\sqrt{9 - \cos^2(x)}} \, dx = \int \frac{-1}{u \sqrt{9 - u^2}} \, du\text{.}
\end{equation*}
By Rule (j) in the appendix, we know that%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{1}{u \sqrt{9 - u^2}} \, du = -\frac{1}{3} \ln \left| \frac{3 + \sqrt{9 - u^2}}{u} \right| + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Connecting the above chain of equalities and substituting back to \(x\), we have shown that%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{\tan(x)}{\sqrt{9 - \cos^2(x)}} \, dx = \frac{1}{3} \ln \left| \frac{3 + \sqrt{9 - \cos^2(x)}}{\cos(x)} \right| + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
When Wolfram|Alpha is asked to evaluate the original integral, its first result involves the inverse hyperbolic tangent function, and the alternate forms are equally complicated. It seems that the technology is unable to evaluate this integral in the most straightforward way.%

Looking at the composite functions that are present, there are two possible \(u\)-substitutions to try. One is \(u = 1+x^2\), for which \(du = 2x \, dx\) and \(x = \sqrt{u-1}\). Because there is no \(x \, dx\) term present in the integral, this substitution will not work.%

\hypertarget{p-5928}{}%
A second subsitution to attempt is letting \(u = x + \sqrt{1+x^2}\), for which \(du = \left(1 + x(1+x^2)^{-1/2} \right) \, dx\). Here, too, the needed product is not present in the integral in order for the subsitution to work.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3801}{}\hypertarget{p-5929}{}%
For integration by parts to work, we normally need a choice of \(u\) that is straightforward to differentiate, and \(dv\) that is straightforward to antidifferentiate. Noting that the integrand can really only be written as the product of \(\frac{1}{x}\) and \(\sqrt{x+\sqrt{1+x^2}}\), it appears that the most natural possible option is to let \(u = \sqrt{x+\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(dv = \frac{1}{x} \, dx\), since we can antidifferentiate \(\frac{1}{x}\). Here, however, the approach stalls, because integration by parts requires us to evaluate \(\int v \, du\), and that integral is%
\begin{equation*}
\int \ln|x| \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left( x + \sqrt{1+x^2} \right)^{-1/2} \cdot \left( 1 + x(1+x^2)^{-1/2} \right) \, dx

which is far more complicated than the already-complicated integral we started with. From this it appears that integration by parts will not be productive.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3802}{}\hypertarget{p-5930}{}%
Since we can't seem to find a \(u\)-substitution that simplifies the given integral, and there are no formulas in the Appendix that use nested square roots, it appears that the table doesn't offer any help in evaluating this particular integral.%

When we first explored finding the net signed area bounded by a curve, we developed the concept of a \hyperref[sec-4-2-Riemann]{Riemann sum~\ref{sec-4-2-Riemann}} as a helpful estimation tool and a key step in the definition of the definite integral. Recall that the left, right, and middle Riemann sums of a function \(f\) on an interval \([a,b]\) are given by%
\begin{align}
L_n = f(x_0) \Delta x + f(x_1) \Delta x + \cdots + f(x_{n-1}) \Delta x \amp= \sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} f(x_i) \Delta x,\label{E-Left}\\
R_n = f(x_1) \Delta x + f(x_2) \Delta x + \cdots + f(x_{n}) \Delta x \amp= \sum_{i = 1}^{n} f(x_i) \Delta x,\label{E-Right}\\
M_n = f(\overline{x}_1) \Delta x + f(\overline{x}_2) \Delta x + \cdots + f(\overline{x}_{n}) \Delta x \amp= \sum_{i = 1}^{n} f(\overline{x}_i) \Delta x\text{,}\label{E-Mid}
\end{align}
where \(x_0 = a\), \(x_i = a + i\Delta x\), \(x_n = b\), and \(\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}\). For the middle sum, we defined \(\overline{x}_{i} = (x_{i-1} + x_i)/2\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5936}{}%
A \emph{Riemann sum} is a sum of (possibly signed) areas of rectangles. The value of \(n\) determines the number of rectangles, and our choice of left endpoints, right endpoints, or midpoints determines the heights of the rectangles. We can see the similarities and differences among these three options in \hyperref[F-5-6-LRMsum]{Figure~\ref{F-5-6-LRMsum}}, where we consider the function \(f(x) = \frac{1}{20}(x-4)^3 + 7\) on the interval \([1,8]\), and use 5 rectangles for each of the Riemann sums.%

While it is a good exercise to compute a few Riemann sums by hand, just to ensure that we understand how they work and how varying the function, the number of subintervals, and the choice of endpoints or midpoints affects the result, using computing technology is a quick way to determine \(L_n\), \(R_n\), and \(M_n\). Any computer algebra system will offer this capability.%

In this section we explore several different alternatives for estimating definite integrals. Our main goal is to develop formulas to estimate definite integrals accurately without using a large numbers of rectangles.%

In addition to changing \(f(x) \) to \(f(x)=x^3 \) and the number of subintervals to \(3 \), make sure to change the Sample Point Placement so that "Relative" is checked and the slide bar is all the way to the left.

You'll see that now it is sampling \(f(x) \) values from the right side of each subinterval. For \(M_3\), make sure to change the Sample Point Placement so that "Relative" is checked and the slide bar is in the middle and the "midpoint" label shows. You'll see that now it is sampling \(f(x) \) values from the middle of each interval.%

In what follows in this section, we will learn a new approach to estimating the value of a definite integral known as the \emph{Trapezoid Rule}. The basic idea is to use trapezoids, rather than rectangles, to estimate the area under a curve. What is the formula for the area of a trapezoid with bases of length \(b_1\) and \(b_2\) and height \(h\)?%
 \hypertarget{p-5955}{}%
The area of a trapezoid with bases of length \(b_1\) and \(b_2\) and height \(h\) is%
\begin{equation*}
A=\frac{h(b_1+b_2)}{2}\text{.}

%
%
\item\hypertarget{li-3814}{}\hypertarget{p-5956}{}%
Working by hand, estimate the area under \(f(x) = x^3\) on \([0,3]\) using three subintervals and three corresponding trapezoids. What is the error in this approximation? How does it compare to the errors you calculated in (d)? \begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.66\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/5_8_trap_ex.jpg}
\caption{Using 3 trapezoids to approximate \(\int_0^3 x^3 \, dx \)\label{figure-223}}

%
 \hypertarget{p-5957}{}%
%
\begin{equation*}
T_3=\frac{45}{2}=22.5
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
E_{T,3}=-2.25
\end{equation*}
%
 \hypertarget{p-5958}{}%
The left-most trapezoid has base lengths 0 and 1 and height 1, so the area of the first trapezoid is \(\frac{1}{2} (0+1)\cdot 1=\frac{1}{2}\). The middle trapezoid has base lengths 1 and 8 and height 1, so the area of the second trapezoid is \(\frac{1}{2}(1+8) \cdot 1=\frac{9}{2} \). The right-most trapezoid has base lengths 8 and 27 and height 1, so the area of the third trapezoid is \(\frac{1}{2}(8+27)\cdot 1=\frac{35}{2}\). Therefore, the approximate area under the graph of \(f(x)=x^3 \) from \(0 \) to \(3 \) using the trapezoid rule with 3 subintervals is \(T_3= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{9}{2} + \frac{35}{2}=\frac{45}{2}=22.5\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5959}{}%
The error is \(E_{T,3}=20.25-22.5=-2.25 \). Using trapezoids creates a smaller error compared to \(L_3 \) and \(R_3 \). The magnitude of the error from approximating using \(M_3 \) is half the magnitude of the error from approximating using \(T_3 \), but they have opposite signs.%

So far, we have used the simplest possible quadrilaterals (that is, rectangles) to estimate areas. It is natural, however, to wonder if other familiar shapes might serve us even better.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5961}{}%
An alternative to \(L_n\), \(R_n\), and \(M_n\) is called the \emph{Trapezoid Rule}. Rather than using a rectangle to estimate the (signed) area bounded by \(y = f(x)\) on a small interval, we use a trapezoid. For example, in \hyperref[F-5-6-TRAP]{Figure~\ref{F-5-6-TRAP}}, we estimate the area under the curve using three subintervals and the trapezoids that result from connecting the corresponding points on the curve with straight lines.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.73\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/5_6_TRAP.pdf}
\caption{Estimating \(\int_a^b f(x) \  dx\) using three subintervals and trapezoids, rather than rectangles, where \(a = x_0\) and \(b = x_3\).\label{F-5-6-TRAP}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-5962}{}%
The biggest difference between the Trapezoid Rule and a Riemann sum is that on each subinterval, the Trapezoid Rule uses two function values, rather than one, to estimate the (signed) area bounded by the curve. For instance, to compute \(D_1\), the area of the trapezoid on \([x_0, x_1]\), we observe that the left base has length \(f(x_0)\), while the right base has length \(f(x_1)\). The height of the trapezoid is \(x_1 - x_0 = \Delta x = \frac{b-a}{3}\). The area of a trapezoid is the average of the bases times the height, so we have%
\begin{equation*}
D_1 = \frac{1}{2}(f(x_0) + f(x_1)) \cdot \Delta x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5963}{}%
Using similar computations for \(D_2\) and \(D_3\), we find that \(T_3\), the trapezoidal approximation to \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\) is given by%
\begin{align*}
T_3 &=  D_1 + D_2 + D_3\\
&= \frac{1}{2}(f(x_0) + f(x_1)) \cdot \Delta x + \frac{1}{2}(f(x_1) + f(x_2)) \cdot \Delta x + \frac{1}{2}(f(x_2) + f(x_3)) \cdot \Delta x\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5964}{}%
Because both left and right endpoints are being used, we recognize within the trapezoidal approximation the use of both left and right Riemann sums. Rearranging the expression for \(T_3\) by removing factors of \(\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\Delta x \), grouping the left endpoint and right endpoint evaluations of \(f\), we see that%
\begin{equation}
T_3 =  \frac{1}{2} \left[ f(x_0) + f(x_1) + f(x_2) \right] \Delta x   +  \frac{1}{2} \left[ f(x_1) + f(x_2) + f(x_3) \right] \Delta x\text{.}\label{E-Trap3}
\end{equation}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5965}{}%
We now observe that two familiar sums have arisen. The left Riemann sum \(L_3\) is \(L_3 = f(x_0) \Delta x + f(x_1) \Delta x + f(x_2) \Delta x\), and the right Riemann sum is \(R_3 = f(x_1) \Delta x + f(x_2) \Delta x + f(x_3) \Delta x\). Substituting \(L_3\) and \(R_3\) for the corresponding expressions in \hyperref[E-Trap3]{Equation~(\ref{E-Trap3})}, it follows that \(T_3 = \frac{1}{2} \left[ L_3 + R_3 \right]\). We have thus seen a very important result: using trapezoids to estimate the (signed) area bounded by a curve is the same as averaging the estimates generated by using left and right endpoints.%
\begin{assemblage}[The Trapezoid Rule]\label{assemblage-123}
\hypertarget{p-5966}{}%
The trapezoidal approximation, \(T_n\), of the definite integral \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\) using \(n\) subintervals is given by the rule%
\begin{align*}
T_n =\mathstrut \amp  \left[\frac{1}{2}(f(x_0) + f(x_1)) + \frac{1}{2}(f(x_1) + f(x_2))  + \cdots + \frac{1}{2}(f(x_{n-1}) + f(x_n)) \right] \Delta x.\\
=\mathstrut \amp  \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \frac{1}{2}(f(x_i) + f(x_{i+1}))  \Delta x\text{.}

Moreover, \(T_n = \frac{1}{2} \left[ L_n + R_n \right]\).%

From the errors in comparison to the known exact value, we see that the trapezoid rule overestimates this definite integral and the midpoint rule underestimates this definite integral.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3834}{}\hypertarget{p-5990}{}%
The graph of the function given by \(f(x) = \dfrac{1}{x^2}\) is concave up on the interval \([1, 2]\). Because of this fact, we can see graphically that the line forming the top of each trapezoid lies fully above the curve, and thus the trapezoid rule overestimates the true value of the definite integral. Later in this section we'll see graphically why this concavity makes the midpoint rule an underestimate.%

\subsection[{Comparing the Midpoint and Trapezoid Rules}]{Comparing the Midpoint and Trapezoid Rules}\label{subsection-151}
\hypertarget{p-5991}{}%
We know from the definition of the definite integral that if we let \(n\) be large enough, we can make any of the approximations \(L_n\), \(R_n\), and \(M_n\) as close as we'd like (in theory) to the exact value of \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\). Thus, it may be natural to wonder why we ever use any rule other than \(L_n\) or \(R_n\) (with a sufficiently large \(n\) value) to estimate a definite integral. One of the primary reasons is that as \(n \to \infty\), \(\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n} \to 0\), and thus in a Riemann sum calculation with a large \(n\) value, we end up multiplying by a number that is very close to zero. Doing so often generates roundoff error, because representing numbers close to zero accurately is a persistent challenge for computers.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5992}{}%
Hence, we explore ways to estimate definite integrals to high levels of precision, but without using extremely large values of \(n\). Paying close attention to patterns in errors, such as those observed in \hyperref[act-5-6-1]{Example~\ref{act-5-6-1}}, is one way to begin to see some alternate approaches.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-5993}{}%
To begin, we compare the errors in the Midpoint and Trapezoid rules. First, consider a function that is concave up on a given interval, and picture approximating the area bounded on that interval by both the Midpoint and Trapezoid rules using a single subinterval.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/5_6_MidVTrap.pdf}
\caption{Estimating \(\int_a^b f(x) \  dx\) using a single subinterval: at left, the trapezoid rule; in the middle, the midpoint rule; at right, a modified way to think about the midpoint rule.\label{F-5-6-MidVTrap}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-5994}{}%
As seen in \hyperref[F-5-6-MidVTrap]{Figure~\ref{F-5-6-MidVTrap}}, it is evident that whenever the function is concave up on an interval, the Trapezoid Rule with one subinterval, \(T_1\), will overestimate the exact value of the definite integral on that interval. From a careful analysis of the line that bounds the top of the rectangle for the Midpoint Rule (shown in magenta), we see that if we rotate this line segment until it is tangent to the curve at the midpoint of the interval (as shown at right in \hyperref[F-5-6-MidVTrap]{Figure~\ref{F-5-6-MidVTrap}}), the resulting trapezoid has the same area as \(M_1\), and this value is less than the exact value of the definite integral. Thus, when the function is concave up on the interval, \(M_1\) underestimates the integral's true value.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.47\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/5_6_MidTrapError.pdf}
\caption{Comparing the error in estimating \(\int_a^b f(x) \  dx\) using a single subinterval: in red, the error from the Trapezoid rule; in light red, the error from the Midpoint rule.\label{F-5-6-MidTrapError}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-5995}{}%
The preceding discussion explores how to determine if \(M_n\) and \(T_n\) are underestimates or overestimates of \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\) if \(f(x)\) is concave up. Similar statements can be made when \(f(x)\) is concave down. These are summarized next.%
\begin{assemblage}[Error types when approximating using Midpoint and Trapezoid Rules]\label{assemblage-124}
\hypertarget{p-5996}{}%
\leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-5997}{}%
If \(f(x)\) is concave up on \([a,b] \), then \(M_n\) underestimates \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\) and \(T_n\) overestimates \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\).%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-5998}{}%
If \(f(x)\) is concave down on \([a,b] \), then \(M_n\) overestimates \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\) and \(T_n\) underestimates \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\).%
\end{itemize}
%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-5999}{}%
Next, we compare the size of the errors between \(M_n\) and \(T_n\). Again, we focus on \(M_1\) and \(T_1\) on an interval where the concavity of \(f\) is consistent. In \hyperref[F-5-6-MidTrapError]{Figure~\ref{F-5-6-MidTrapError}}, where the error of the Trapezoid Rule is shaded in red, while the error of the Midpoint Rule is shaded lighter red, it is visually apparent that the error in the Trapezoid Rule is more significant. To see how much more significant, let's consider two examples and some particular computations.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6000}{}%
If we let \(f(x) = 1-x^2\) and consider \(\int_0^1 f(x) \,dx\), we know by the First FTC that the exact value of the integral is%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^1 (1-x^2) \, dx = x - \frac{x^3}{3} \bigg\vert_0^1 = \frac{2}{3}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6001}{}%
Using appropriate technology to compute \(M_4\), \(M_8\), \(T_4\), and \(T_8\), as well as the corresponding errors \(E_{M,4}\), \(E_{M,8}\), \(E_{T,4}\), and \(E_{T,8}\), as we did in \hyperref[act-5-6-1]{Example~\ref{act-5-6-1}}, we find the results summarized in \hyperref[T-5-6-Ex2]{Table~\ref{T-5-6-Ex2}}. We also include the approximations and their errors for the example \(\int_1^2 \frac{1}{x^2} \, dx\) from \hyperref[act-5-6-1]{Example~\ref{act-5-6-1}}.%

\end{table}
\hypertarget{p-6002}{}%
For a given function \(f\) and interval \([a,b]\), \(E_{T,4} = \int_a^b f(x) \,dx - T_4\) calculates the difference between the exact value of the definite integral and the approximation generated by the Trapezoid Rule with \(n = 4\). If we look at not only \(E_{T,4}\), but also the other errors generated by using \(T_n\) and \(M_n\) with \(n = 4\) and \(n = 8\) in the two examples noted in \hyperref[T-5-6-Ex2]{Table~\ref{T-5-6-Ex2}}, we see an evident pattern. Not only is the sign of the error (which measures whether the rule generates an over- or under-estimate) tied to the rule used and the function's concavity, but the magnitude of the errors generated by \(T_n\) and \(M_n\) seems closely connected. In particular, the errors generated by the Midpoint Rule seem to be about half the size of those generated by the Trapezoid Rule.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6003}{}%
That is, we can observe in both examples that \(E_{M,4} \approx -\frac{1}{2} E_{T,4}\) and \(E_{M,8} \approx -\frac{1}{2}E_{T,8}\). This property of the Midpoint and Trapezoid Rules turns out to hold in general: for a function of consistent concavity, the error in the Midpoint Rule has the opposite sign and approximately half the magnitude of the error of the Trapezoid Rule. Written symbolically,%
\begin{equation*}
E_{M,n} \approx -\frac{1}{2} E_{T,n}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6004}{}%
This important relationship suggests a way to combine the Midpoint and Trapezoid Rules to create an even more accurate approximation to a definite integral.%

\typeout{Subsection 5.9.3 Simpson's Rule}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[{Simpson's Rule}]{Simpson's Rule}\label{subsection-152}
\index{Simpson's rule}\hypertarget{p-6005}{}%
When we first developed the Trapezoid Rule, we observed that it is an average of the Left and Right Riemann sums:%
\begin{equation*}
T_n = \frac{1}{2}(L_n + R_n)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6006}{}%
If a function is always increasing or always decreasing on the interval \([a,b]\), one of \(L_n\) and \(R_n\) will over-estimate the true value of \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\), while the other will under-estimate the integral. Thus, the errors found in \(L_n\) and \(R_n\) will have opposite signs; so averaging \(L_n\) and \(R_n\) eliminates a considerable amount of the error present in the respective approximations. In a similar way, it makes sense to think about averaging \(M_n\) and \(T_n\) in order to generate a still more accurate approximation.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6007}{}%
We've just observed that \(M_n\) is typically about twice as accurate as \(T_n\). This leads to an approximation method known as \emph{Simpson's Rule} \footnote{Thomas Simpson was an 18th century mathematician; his idea was to extend the Trapezoid rule, but rather than using straight lines to build trapezoids, to use quadratic functions to build regions whose area was bounded by parabolas (whose areas he could find exactly). Simpson's Rule is often developed from the more sophisticated perspective of using interpolation by quadratic functions.\label{fn-63}} which is a weighted average of the Midpoint and Trapezoid approximations.%
\begin{assemblage}[Simpson's Rule]\label{assemblage-125}
\hypertarget{p-6008}{}%
The Simpson's Rule approximation \(S_{2n} \) of the area \(\int_a^b f(x) \ dx \) is the weighted average \index{weighted average}%
\begin{equation}
S_{2n} = \frac{2M_n + T_n}{3}\text{.}\label{E-Simpson}
\end{equation}
where \(M_n \) and \(T_n \) are the Midpoint and Trapezoid rule approximations using \(n \) subintervals.%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-6009}{}%
Note that we use ``\(S_{2n}\)'' rather that ``\(S_n\)'' since the \(n\) points the Midpoint Rule uses are different from the \(n\) points the Trapezoid Rule uses, and thus Simpson's Rule is using \(2n\) points at which to evaluate the function. We build upon the results in \hyperref[T-5-6-Ex2]{Table~\ref{T-5-6-Ex2}} to see the approximations generated by Simpson's Rule. In particular, in \hyperref[T-5-6-Ex3]{Table~\ref{T-5-6-Ex3}}, we include all of the results in \hyperref[T-5-6-Ex2]{Table~\ref{T-5-6-Ex2}}, but include additional results for \(S_8 = \frac{2M_4 + T_4}{3}\) and \(S_{16} = \frac{2M_8 + T_8}{3}\).%

\end{table}
\hypertarget{p-6010}{}%
The results seen in \hyperref[T-5-6-Ex3]{Table~\ref{T-5-6-Ex3}} are striking. If we consider the \(S_{16}\) approximation of \(\int_1^2 \frac{1}{x^2} \, dx\), the error is only \(E_{S,16} = 0.0000019434\). By contrast, \(L_8 = 0.5491458502\), so the error of that estimate is \(E_{L,8} = -0.0491458502\). Moreover, we observe that generating the approximations for Simpson's Rule is almost no additional work: once we have \(L_n\), \(R_n\), and \(M_n\) for a given value of \(n\), it is a simple exercise to generate \(T_n\), and from there to calculate \(S_{2n}\). Finally, note that the error in the Simpson's Rule approximations of \(\int_0^1 (1-x^2) \, dx\) is zero!\footnote{Similar to how the Midpoint and Trapezoid approximations are exact for linear functions, Simpson's Rule approximations are exact for quadratic and cubic functions. See additional discussion on this issue later in the section and in the exercises.\label{fn-64}}%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6011}{}%
These rules are not only useful for approximating definite integrals such as \(\int_0^1 e^{-x^2} \, dx\), for which we cannot find an elementary antiderivative of \(e^{-x^2}\), but also for approximating definite integrals when we are given a function through a table of data.%

Since the velocity is always positive, the definite integral that will give the exact distance traveled by the car on the interval \([0, 1.8]\) is%

%
\item\hypertarget{li-3860}{}\hypertarget{p-6040}{}%
Simpson's rule gives the best approximation of the distance traveled since it is a weighted average of the midpoint and trapezoid rules and uses more information about the velocity than the other methods. The units on each of the estimates, including Simpson's Rule, are "feet", since ft/sec \(\cdot\) sec = ft. Thus, the best approximation we have generated is that \(\int_0^{1.8} v(t) dt \approx 140.8 \text{ ft }\).%

We observe that each of the left endpoint rule results are overestimates, each of the right endpoint rules are underestimates, each of the midpoint rules are overestimates, and each of the trapezoid rules are underestimates.

For Simpson's rule, we see that the result is exact for both \(f\) and \(g\), while Simpson's rule is a slight overestimate of \(\int_0^1 h(x) dx\).%

\hypertarget{p-6068}{}%
The results seen in \hyperref[act-5-6-3]{Example~\ref{act-5-6-3}} generalize nicely. For instance, if \(f\) is decreasing on \([a,b]\), \(L_n\) will overestimate the exact value of \(\int_a^b f(x) \,dx\), and if \(f\) is concave down on \([a,b]\), \(M_n\) will overestimate the exact value of the integral. An excellent exercise is to write a collection of scenarios of possible function behavior, and then categorize whether each of \(L_n\), \(R_n\), \(T_n\), and \(M_n\) is an over- or under-estimate.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6069}{}%
Finally, we make two important notes about Simpson's Rule. When T.~Simpson first developed this rule, his idea was to replace the function \(f\) on a given interval with a quadratic function that shared three values with the function \(f\). In so doing, he guaranteed that this new approximation rule would be exact for the definite integral of any quadratic polynomial. In one of the pleasant surprises of numerical analysis, it turns out that even though it was designed to be exact for quadratic polynomials, Simpson's Rule is exact for any cubic polynomial: that is, if we are interested in an integral such as \(\int_2^5 (5x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 4)\, dx\), the approximation \(S_{2n}\) will always be exact, regardless of the value of \(n\). This is just one more piece of evidence that shows how effective Simpson's Rule is as an approximation tool for estimating definite integrals.\footnote{One reason that Simpson's Rule is so effective is that \(S_{2n}\) benefits from using \(2n+1\) points of data. Because it combines \(M_n\), which uses \(n\) midpoints, and \(T_n\), which uses the \(n+1\) endpoints of the chosen subintervals, \(S_{2n}\) takes advantage of the maximum amount of information we have when we know function values at the endpoints and midpoints of \(n\) subintervals.\label{fn-65}}%

\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-6071}{}%
For a definite integral such as \(\int_0^1 e^{-x^2} \, dx\) when we cannot use the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus because the integrand lacks an elementary algebraic antiderivative, we can estimate the integral's value by using a sequence of Riemann sum approximations. Typically, we start by computing \(L_n\), \(R_n\), and \(M_n\) for one or more chosen values of \(n\).%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-6072}{}%
The Trapezoid Rule, which estimates \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\) by using trapezoids, rather than rectangles, can also be viewed as the average of Left and Right Riemann sums. That is, \(T_n = \frac{1}{2}(L_n + R_n)\).%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-6073}{}%
The Midpoint Rule is typically twice as accurate as the Trapezoid Rule, and the signs of the respective errors of these rules are opposites. Hence, by taking the weighted average \(S_{2n} = \frac{2M_n + T_n}{3}\), we can build a much more accurate approximation to \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\) by using approximations we have already computed. The rule for \(S_{2n}\) is known as Simpson's Rule, which can also be developed by approximating a given continuous function with pieces of quadratic polynomials.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-6074}{}%
By understanding the approximation rule chosen, and the properties of the function (i.e. whether it is increasing or decreasing, or concave up or down on the interval in question), we can say whether the approximation is an over or under-estimate of the actual value.%

We can't use \(u\)-substitution since there's not a function-derivative pair present (nor even a composite function). To show that integration by parts doesn't work is more complicated, but comes down to the fact that if we use the natural choice of \(u = x\) and \(dv = \tan(x) \, dx\), to do so requires us to evaluate the integral \(\int \ln(\sec(x)) \, dx\), which appears not to have an elementary antiderivative. If we try instead \(u = \tan(x)\) and \(dv = x \, dx\), then we have to evaluate the integral \(\int x^2 \cdot \sec^2(x) \, dx\) which is more complicated than the integral we started with and would seem to send us back where we started if we attempt integration by parts.%

Because \(L_4 = 7.23 \gt 6.75 = R_4\) and we know the function is always increasing or always decreasing, for the left endpoint rule to give a value greater than the right endpoint rule, \(f\) must be always decreasing.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3915}{}\hypertarget{p-6111}{}%
From the given data, we know that%
\begin{equation*}
T_4 = \frac{L_4 + R_4}{2} = \frac{7.23 + 6.75}{2} = 6.99\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Since \(M_4 = 7.05\), it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
R_4 \lt T_4 \lt M_4 \lt L_4\text{.}
\end{equation*}
In particular, we know that the function is not only always decreasing on the interval, but it also concave down. Because the concavity is constant, it follows that if the trapezoid rule under-estimates the true value, then the midpoint rule must over-estimate the true value (or vice-versa). Since \(T_4 \lt M_4\), this means that%
\begin{equation*}
T_4 \lt \int_3^6 f(x) \, dx \lt M_4
\end{equation*}
and that \(f\) must be concave down on the interval.%

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-3925}{}\hypertarget{p-6125}{}%
Because \(r(t)\) is measured in thousands of cubic feet per second and \(\triangle t\) is measured in seconds, the definite integral%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^{60} r(t) \, dt
\end{equation*}
measures the total amount of water (in thousands of cubic feet) that flow through the dam in 60 seconds.%
\item\hypertarget{li-3926}{}\hypertarget{p-6126}{}%
With \(7\) function values and thus \(6\) subintervals as the maximum number of intervals we can use, we can compute \(M_3\) since we need to use every other data point to evaluate the function. Doing so,%
\begin{align*}
\int_0^{60} r(t) \, dt &\approx M_3\\
&= r(10) \cdot 20 + r(30) \cdot 20 + r(50) \cdot 20\\
&= (2100 + 3000 + 5100) \cdot 20\\
&= 204000\text{.}
\end{align*}
Thus, approximately \(204 000 000\) cubic feet of water pass through the dam on the interval \(0 \le t \le 60\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6127}{}%
We observe that \(r\) appears to be increasing at an increasing rate on \(0 \le t \le 60\). In particular, the data suggests that \(r\) is concave up on the interval. As such, the trapezoid rule will over-estimate the true value of the definite integral and the midpoint rule will under-estimate the value. Thus,%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^{60} r(t) \, dt \gt M_3 = 204000\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-3927}{}\hypertarget{p-6128}{}%
In order to estimate the integral using \(S_6\), we need to know the value of \(T_3\) along with \(M_3\). To find \(T_3\), we compute \(L_3\) and \(R_3\). First%
\begin{equation*}
L_3 = r(0) \cdot 20 + r(20) \cdot 20 + r(40) \cdot 20 = (2000 + 2400 + 3900) \cdot 20 = 166000\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Similarly,%
\begin{equation*}
R_3 = r(20) \cdot 20 + r(40) \cdot 20 + r(60) \cdot 20 = (2400 + 3900 + 6500) \cdot 20 = 256000\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Thus,%
\begin{equation*}
T_3 = \frac{L_3 + R_3}{2} = \frac{166000 + 256000}{2} = 211000\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Finally, we now have the information needed to compute \(S_6\). We thus find that%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^{60} r(t) \, dt \approx S_6 = \frac{2M_3 + T_3}{3} = \frac{2 \cdot 204000 + 211000}{3} = \frac{619000}{3} \approx 206333.33\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-3928}{}\hypertarget{p-6129}{}%
First,%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{60} S_6 = \frac{206333.33}{60} = \frac{30950}{9} \approx 3438.89\text{.}
\end{equation*}
This is one estimate for the average value of \(r\) on \([0,60]\) since%
\begin{equation*}
r_{\operatorname{AVG} [0,60]} = \frac{1}{60-0} \int_0^{60} r(t) \, dt\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and \(\int_0^{60} r(t) \, dt \approx S_6\). Thus, on average, water is flowing through the dam at a rate of \(3438.89\) thousand cubic feet per second.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6130}{}%
Next,%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{2000+2100+2400+3000+3900+5100+6500}{7} = \frac{25000}{7} \approx 3571.43
\end{equation*}
is the average of the \(7\) known values of \(r(t)\) on the interval \([0,60]\), and thus is one estiamte of the average value of \(r\). This average treats all of them equally, as opposed to \(S_6\) which counts midpoints more than endpoints and is developed in such a way to remove some of the error inherent in using simple estimates like \(L_6\) and \(R_6\). This simple average of \(7\) rate values is analogous to using a left or right Riemann sum, and thus we expect that the estimate of the average value of \(r\) that comes from \(S_6\) is more accurate for computing the average rate at which water flows through the dam.%

%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-6131}{}%
What are improper integrals and why are they important?%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-6132}{}%
What does it mean to say that an improper integral converges or diverges?%

\end{itemize}
\end{objectives}
\hypertarget{p-6135}{}%
So far we have considered integrals of continuous functions over finite intervals of integration. However, in many applications, we may need to integrate over an unbounded interval. That is, at least one of the limits of integration is infinite. In other cases, we may have an integrand that becomes infinite at a point within the interval or at an endpoint of the interval.  Such cases are called \emph{improper integrals}.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6136}{}%
In this section we learn how to evaluate these integrals. It may be surprising that despite having regions that appear infinite, in many cases the area is finite. We first look at some examples of how such integrals may arise.%
\begin{example}[]\label{Ex-Imp-Int-1}
\hypertarget{p-6137}{}%
Consider a company that manufactures incandescent light bulbs. Based on a large volume of test results, they have determined that the fraction of light bulbs that fail between times \(t = a\) and \(t = b\) of use (where \(t\) is measured in months) is given by%
\begin{equation*}
\int_a^b 0.3 e^{-0.3t} \, dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6138}{}%
For example, the fraction of light bulbs that fail during their third month of use is given by%
\begin{align*}
\int_2^3 0.3e^{-0.3t} \, dt \amp = -e^{-0.3t} \bigg \vert_2^3\\
\amp = -e^{-0.9} + e^{-0.6}\\
\amp \approx  0.1422\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6139}{}%
Thus about 14.22\% of all lightbulbs fail between \(t = 2\) and \(t = 3\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6140}{}%
We can adjust the limits of integration to measure the fraction of light bulbs that fail during any time period of interest. For example, to find the fraction of light bulbs that fail \emph{eventually}, we wish to find%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{b \to \infty} \int_0^b 0.3e^{-0.3t} \, dt\text{,}
\end{equation*}
for which we will also use the notation%
\begin{equation}
\int_0^\infty 0.3e^{-0.3t} \, dt\text{.}\label{E-ImpInt1}
\end{equation}
%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-6141}{}%
The integral in \hyperref[Ex-Imp-Int-1]{Example~\ref{Ex-Imp-Int-1}} can be interpreted as the area of an unbounded region, as pictured at right in \hyperref[F-6-5-InfReg]{Figure~\ref{F-6-5-InfReg}}.%

In view of the above example, we see that we may want to integrate over an interval whose upper limit grows without bound.%

\hypertarget{p-6146}{}%
We call an integral for which the interval of integration is unbounded \emph{improper}. \index{improper integral!unbounded region of integration} For instance, the integrals%
\begin{equation*}
\int_1^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^2} \, dx, \ \ \int_{-\infty}^0 \frac{1}{1+x^2} \, dx, \ \ \text{and}  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} \, dx
\end{equation*}
are all improper because they have limits of integration that involve \(\infty\). To evaluate an improper integral we replace it with a limit of proper integrals. That is,%

\int_0^\infty f(x) \, dx = \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_0^b f(x) \,dx\text{.}

\hypertarget{p-6239}{}%
An integral is also called \emph{improper} if the integrand is unbounded on the interval of integration. For example, consider%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Because \(f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}\) has a vertical asymptote at \(x = 0\), \(f\) is not continuous on \([0,1]\), and the integral represents the area of the unbounded region shown at right in \hyperref[F-6-5-InfIntegrand]{Figure~\ref{F-6-5-InfIntegrand}}.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/6_5_InfIntegrand.pdf}
\caption{At left, the area bounded by \(f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}\) on the finite interval \([a,1]\); at right, the result of letting \(a \to 0^+\), where we see that the shaded region will extend vertically without bound.\label{F-6-5-InfIntegrand}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-6240}{}%
We address the problem of the integrand being unbounded \index{improper integral!unbounded integrand} by replacing the improper integral with a limit of proper integrals. For example, to evaluate \(\int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \, dx\), we replace \(0\) with \(a\) and let \(a\) approach 0 from the right. Thus,%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \, dx = \lim_{a \to 0^+} \int_a^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
We evaluate the proper integral \(\int_a^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \, dx\), and then take the limit. We will say that the improper integral converges if this limit exists, and diverges otherwise. In this example, we observe that%
\begin{align*}
\int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \, dx &=  \lim_{a \to 0^+} \int_a^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \, dx\\
&= \lim_{a \to 0^+} 2\sqrt{x} \big\vert_a^1\\
&= \lim_{a \to 0^+} 2\sqrt{1} - 2\sqrt{a}\\
&= 2\text{,}
\end{align*}
so the improper integral \(\int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}} \, dx\) converges (to the value 2).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6241}{}%
We have to be particularly careful with unbounded integrands, for they may arise in ways that may not initially be obvious. Consider, for instance, the integral%
\begin{equation*}
\int_1^3 \frac{1}{(x-2)^2} \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6242}{}%
At first glance we might think that we can simply apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus by antidifferentiating \(\frac{1}{(x-2)^2}\) to get \(-\frac{1}{x-2}\) and then evaluating from \(1\) to \(3\). Were we to do so, we would be erroneously applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus because \(f(x) = \frac{1}{(x-2)^2}\) fails to be continuous throughout the interval, as seen in \hyperref[F-6-5-InfIntegrand2]{Figure~\ref{F-6-5-InfIntegrand2}}.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.47\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/6_5_InfIntegrand2.pdf}
\caption{The function \(f(x) = \frac{1}{(x-2)^2}\) on an interval including \(x = 2\).\label{F-6-5-InfIntegrand2}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-6243}{}%
Such an incorrect application of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus leads to an impossible result (\(-2\)), which would itself suggest that something we did must be wrong. Instead, we must address the vertical asymptote at \(x = 2\) by writing%
\begin{equation*}
\int_1^3 \frac{1}{(x-2)^2} \, dx = \lim_{a \to 2^-} \int_1^a \frac{1}{(x-2)^2} \, dx + \lim_{b \to 2^+} \int_b^3 \frac{1}{(x-2)^2} \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
We then evaluate two separate limits of proper integrals. For instance, doing so for the integral with \(a\) approaching \(2\) from the left, we find%
\begin{align*}
\int_1^2 \frac{1}{(x-2)^2} \, dx&= \lim_{a \to 2^-} \int_1^a \frac{1}{(x-2)^2} \, dx\\
&= \lim_{a \to 2^-} -\frac{1}{(x-2)} \bigg\vert_1^a\\
&= \lim_{a \to 2^-} -\frac{1}{(a-2)} + \frac{1}{1-2}\\
&= \infty\text{,}
\end{align*}
since \(\frac{1}{a-2} \to -\infty\) as \(a\) approaches 2 from the left. Thus, the improper integral \(\int_1^2 \frac{1}{(x-2)^2} \, dx\) diverges; similar work shows that \(\int_2^3 \frac{1}{(x-2)^2} \, dx\) also diverges. From either of these two results, we can conclude that that the original integral, \(\int_1^3 \frac{1}{(x-2)^2} \, dx\) diverges, too.%

\subsection[{Important Classes of Improper Integrals}]{Important Classes of Improper Integrals}\label{subsection-158}
\hypertarget{p-6276}{}%
There are three important classes of improper integrals that we will use in the subsection \hyperref[ComparingImpInt]{Comparing Improper Integrals~\ref{ComparingImpInt}}. The three classes are \(\int_1^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^p} \, dx \) where \(p \) is a real number, \(\int_0^1 \frac{1}{x^p} \, dx \) where \(p \) is a real number, and \(\int_0^{\infty} \frac{1}{e^{ax}}\, dx \) where \(a \) is a real number. We will use the convergence behavior of these improper integrals which have simple integrands to gain understanding of the convergence behavior of improper integrals whose integrands are more complex. For each of these classes, the value of \(p\) or \(a \) will determine if the improper integral converges or diverges.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-251}
\hypertarget{p-6277}{}%
Determine the values of \(p \) so that \(\int_1^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^p} \, dx \) converges. In addition, determine the values of \(p \) so that \(\int_1^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^p} \, dx \) diverges.%
\par\smallskip%

\hypertarget{p-6278}{}%
\(\int_1^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^p} \ dx \) converges if \(p>1 \) and diverges if \(p\leq 1 \)%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-333}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-6279}{}%
First, set up a limit to properly evaluate the improper integral.%
\begin{equation*}
\int_1^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^p} \, dx = \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_1^b x^{-p} \, dx 
\end{equation*}
Notice that the antiderivative is different if \(p=1 \) or \(p \neq 1 \), so we'll calculate these cases separately. Assume \(p\neq 1 \).%
\begin{align*}
\int_1^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^p} \, dx &= \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_1^b x^{-p} \, dx \\
&= \lim_{b \to \infty} \left. \frac{x^{-p+1}}{-p+1} \right|_1^b \\
&= \lim_{b \to \infty} \frac{b^{-p+1}}{-p+1} - \frac{1}{-p+1} \\
&= -\frac{1}{-p+1} + \frac{1}{-p+1} \lim_{b \to \infty} b^{-p+1} 
\end{align*}
If \(-p+1 >0 \) (so \(p <1 \)) then this limit diverges which implies that the improper integral diverges.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6280}{}%
If \(-p+1 < 0 \) (so \(p > 1 \)) then this limit converges which implies that the improper integral converges.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6281}{}%
Now, assume \(p=1 \).%
\begin{align*}
\int_1^{\infty} \frac{1}{x} \, dx &= \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_1^b \frac{1}{x} \, dx \\
& =\lim_{b \to \infty} \left. \ln |x| \right|_1^b \\
& =\lim_{b \to \infty} \ln|b| - \ln|1|\\
&= \lim_{b \to \infty} \ln |b| 
\end{align*}
This limit diverges, so the improper integral also diverges. Therefore \(\int_1^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^p} \ dx \) converges if \(p>1 \) and diverges if \(p\leq 1 \).%
\end{example}
\begin{example}[]\label{example-252}

Determine the values of \(p \) so that \(\int_0^1 \frac{1}{x^p} \, dx \) converges. In addition, determine the values of \(p \) so that \(\int_0^1 \frac{1}{x^p} \, dx \) diverges.%

\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-334}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-6284}{}%
The integrand is undefined at \(x=0 \), so we need to set up a limit that approaches 0 from the right for the lower bound of the integral.%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^1 \frac{1}{x^p} \, dx = \lim_{a \to 0^{+}} \int_a^1  x^{-p} \, dx
\end{equation*}
The gereral antiderivative is different if \(p=1 \) or \(p \neq 1 \), so we will handle each case separately. Assume \(p \neq 1 \).%
\begin{align*}
\int_0^1 \frac{1}{x^p} \, dx &= \lim_{a \to 0^{+}} \int_a^1  x^{-p} \, dx \\
&= \lim_{a \to 0^{+}} \left. \frac{x^{-p+1}}{-p+1} \right|  \\
&= \lim_{a \to 0^{+}} \frac{1}{-p+1} - \frac{a^{-p+1}}{-p+1} \\
&= \frac{1}{-p+1} -\frac{1}{-p+1} \lim_{a \to 0^{+}} a^{-p+1} 
\end{align*}
If \(-p+1>0 \) (so \(p< 1\)) then the limit converges so the improper integral converges.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6285}{}%
If \(-p+1<0 \) (so \(p> 1 \)) then the limit diverges so that improper integral diverges.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6286}{}%
Assume \(p=1\).%
\begin{align*}
\int_0^1 \frac{1}{x} \, dx &= \lim_{a \to 0^{+}} \int_a^1 \frac{1}{x} \, dx \\
& =\lim_{a \to 0^{+}}\left. \ln |x| \right|_a^1\\
& =\lim_{a \to 0^{+}} \ln (1) - \ln(a) \\
& =\lim_{a \to 0^{+}} 0 - \ln(a) 
\end{align*}
This limit diverges so the improper integral diverges. Therefore, \(\int_0^{1} \frac{1}{x^p} \ dx \) converges if \(p < 1 \) and diverges if \(p \geq 1 \).%

\hypertarget{p-6289}{}%
Set up a limit to carefully calculate the improper integral.%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^{\infty} e^{-ax} \, dx = \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_0^b e^{-ax} \, dx 
\end{equation*}
The antiderivative is different if \(a=0 \) or if \(a \neq 0\), so we'll calculate these cases separately. Assume \(a \neq 0 \).%
\begin{align*}
\int_0^{\infty} e^{-ax} \, dx &= \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_0^b e^{-ax} \, dx  \\
&= \lim_{b \to \infty} \left. -\frac{1}{a} e^{-ax} \right|_0^b \\
&= -\frac{1}{a} \lim_{b \to \infty} \left( e^{-ab} -1 \right) \\
&=\frac{1}{a} -\frac{1}{a} \lim_{b \to \infty} e^{-ab} 
\end{align*}
If \(-ab \lt 0\) (so \(a\gt0\)), then the limit converges which implies the improper integral converges.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6290}{}%
If \(-ab \gt 0 \) (so \(a\lt0\)), then the limit diverges which implies the improper integral diverges.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6291}{}%
Assume \(a=0\).%
\begin{align*}
\int_0^{\infty} e^{0} \, dx &= \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_0^b 1 \, dx \\
&= \lim_{b \to \infty} \left. x \right|_0^b\\
&= \lim_{b \to \infty} b
\end{align*}
This limit diverges, so the improper integral diverges. Therefore, \(\int_0^{\infty} \frac{1}{e^{ax}} \ dx \) converges if \(a>0 \) and diverges if \(a\leq0 \).%

\subsection[{Comparing Improper Integrals}]{Comparing Improper Integrals}\label{ComparingImpInt}
\hypertarget{p-6296}{}%
Sometimes we may encounter an improper integral for which we cannot easily evaluate the limit of the corresponding proper integral. For instance, consider \(\int_1^{\infty} \frac{1}{1+x^3} \, dx\). While it is hard (or perhaps impossible) to find an antiderivative for \(\frac{1}{1+x^3}\), we can still determine whether or not the improper integral converges or diverges by comparison to a simpler one. Observe that for all \(x \gt 0\), \(1 + x^3 \gt x^3\), and therefore%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{1+x^3} \lt  \frac{1}{x^3}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6297}{}%
It therefore follows that%
\begin{equation*}
\int_1^b \frac{1}{1+x^3} \, dx \lt  \int_1^b \frac{1}{x^3} \, dx
\end{equation*}
for every \(b \gt 1\). If we let \(b \to \infty\) so as to consider the two improper integrals \(\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{1+x^3} \, dx\) and \(\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{x^3} \, dx\), we know that the larger of the two improper integrals converges. And thus, since the smaller one lies below a convergent integral, it follows that the smaller one must converge, too. The comparison of the values of these improper integrals can be visualized by comparing the area under each function. The area under the curve \(\frac{1}{x^3} \) is shown in green, and the area under the curve \(\frac{1}{x^3+1} \) is shown in blue. \begin{figure}

\caption{Comparing the area under the curves \(\frac{1}{x^3}\) and \(\frac{1}{x^3+1} \)\label{figure-232}}
\end{figure}
 In particular, \(\int_1^\infty \frac{1}{1+x^3} \, dx\) must converge, even though we never explicitly evaluated the corresponding limit of proper integrals. We use this idea and similar ones in the examples that follow.%

Since \(x \ge 1\), it follows that \(x + 1 \ge 1 \gt 0\), so adding \(x^2\) to both sides of this inequality shows that%
\begin{equation*}
x^2 + x + 1 \gt x^2
\end{equation*}
for all \(x \ge 1\). Taking reciprocals (which reverses the inequality),%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{x^2 + x + 1} \lt \frac{1}{x^2}
\end{equation*}
and thus for any \(b \gt 1\),%
\begin{equation*}
\int_1^b \frac{1}{x^2 + x + 1} \, dx \lt \int_1^b \frac{1}{x^2} \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Taking the limit as \(b \to \infty\), it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
\int_1^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^2 + x + 1} \, dx \lt \int_1^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^2} \, dx\text{,}
\end{equation*}

Since for each \(x \gt 1\), \(\ln(x) \lt  x\), it also holds that \(\ln(x) \lt  x\) for all \(x \gt 2\). Taking reciprocals,%

\end{equation*}
and thus%
\begin{equation*}
\int_2^b \frac{1}{x} \, dx \lt  \int_2^b \frac{1}{\ln(x)} \,dx

for each \(b \gt 2\). Taking the limit as \(b \to \infty\), we have%
\begin{equation*}
\int_2^{\infty} \frac{1}{x} \, dx \le  \int_2^{\infty} \frac{1}{\ln(x)} \,dx

\frac{x^4+1}{x^4} \gt 1

for all \(x \gt 1\), and thus taking square roots,%
\begin{equation*}
\sqrt{\frac{x^4+1}{x^4}} \gt 1

for all \(x \gt 1\). Integrating from \(1\) to \(b\) and then letting \(b \to \infty\), we can next say that%
\begin{equation*}
\int_1^{\infty} \sqrt{\frac{x^4+1}{x^4}}  \, dx \ge \int_1^{\infty} 1  \, dx

It is obvious that \(\int_1^{\infty} 1 \, dx\) diverges since the integrand does not tend to \(0\). By the last inequality above, we can conclude that%

Part (b) demonstrates that if we bound an improper integral from below by one that diverges with the same bounds, then we know the improper integral in question also diverges. The goal for the inequality needed for a comparison is different if we want to show convergence or divergence. Because of this difference when trying to use a comparison to determine the convergence of an improper integral, you first need to make a guess\footnote{Example ***with reference*** discusses how to guess an appropriate comparison function, and by doing so guessing if the improper integral converges or diverges.\label{fn-66}} if the improper integral converges or diverges. The general principle for using comparisons to test the convergence of improper integrals is summarized in the box below. \begin{assemblage}[Comparison Test for Improper Integrals]\label{assemblage-131}
\hypertarget{p-6310}{}%
If \(f(x) \ge g(x) \ge 0 \)  and  \(\int_a^{\infty} f(x) \, dx \) converges, then \(\int_a^{\infty} g(x) \, dx \) converges.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6311}{}%
If \(f(x) \ge g(x) \ge 0   \)  and  \(\int_a^{\infty} g(x) \, dx \) diverges, then \(\int_a^{\infty} f(x) \, dx \) diverges.%
\end{assemblage}
 In Part (b), we needed to know that \(\int_2^{\infty} \frac{1}{x} \, dx \) diverges, but we've technically only discussed that \(\int_1^{\infty} \frac{1}{x} \, dx\) diverges. Both of these improper integrals diverge because the integral \(\int_1^2 \frac{1}{x} \, dx \) is finite, so choosing to exclude the area under \(\frac{1}{x}\) on the interval \([1,2]\) from the area under \(\frac{1}{x}\) on the interval \([1, \infty]\) does not change that the area under the curve is infinite. Thus, \(\int_2^{\infty} \frac{1}{x} \, dx\) diverges since \(\int_1^{\infty} \frac{1}{x} \, dx \) diverges. In fact, \(\int_a^{\infty} \frac{1}{x} \, dx\) diverges for any real number \(a \geq 1\) since \(\frac{1}{x} \) is continuous on the interval \([1, a]\). \begin{assemblage}[]\label{assemblage-132}

\item{}\hypertarget{p-6317}{}%
An integral \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\) can be improper if at least one of \(a\) or \(b\) is \(\pm \infty\), making the interval unbounded, or if \(f\) has a vertical asymptote at \(x = c\) for some value of \(c\) that satisfies \(a \le c \le b\). One reason that improper integrals are important is that certain probabilities can be represented by integrals that involve infinite limits.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-6318}{}%
When we encounter an improper integral, we work to understand it by replacing the improper integral with a limit of proper integrals. For instance, we write%
\begin{equation*}
\int_a^\infty f(x) \, dx = \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_a^b f(x) \, dx\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and then work to determine whether the limit exists and is finite. For any improper integral, if the resulting limit of proper integrals exists and is finite, we say the improper integral converges. Otherwise, the improper integral diverges.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-6319}{}%
There are three important classes of improper integrals discussed in this section. %
\begin{itemize}[label=$\circ$]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-6320}{}%
One important class of improper integrals is given by%
\begin{equation*}
\int_1^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^p} \, dx
\end{equation*}
where \(p\) is a positive real number. We can show that this improper integral converges whenever \(p \gt 1\) and diverges whenever \(p \le 1\).%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-6321}{}%
A related class of improper integrals is%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^1 \frac{1}{x^p} \, dx, 
\end{equation*}
which converges for \(p \lt  1\) and diverges for \(p \ge 1\).%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-6322}{}%
Another class of improper integrals is%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^{\infty} e^{-ax} \, dx, 
\end{equation*}
which converges when \(a \gt 0 \) and diverges when \(a \leq 0 \).%
\end{itemize}
%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-6323}{}%
These important classes of improper integrals are used for comparisons in the Comparison Test for Improper Integrals. The Comparison Test for Improper Integrals allows us to determine if an improper integral converges or diverges without having to calculate the antiderivative. The actual test states the following:%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6324}{}%
If \(f(x) \ge g(x) \ge 0 \)  and  \(\int_a^{\infty} f(x) \, dx \) converges, then \(\int_a^{\infty} g(x) \, dx \) converges.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6325}{}%
If \(f(x) \ge g(x) \ge 0   \)  and  \(\int_a^{\infty} g(x) \, dx \) diverges, then \(\int_a^{\infty} f(x) \, dx \) diverges.%

We write the improper integral as a limit and use the substitution \(u = \ln(x)\) and \(du = \frac{1}{x} \ dx\) to evaluate the definite integral, then take the limit:%
\begin{align*}
\int_e^{\infty} \frac{\ln(x)}{x} \, dx  &= \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_e^{b} \frac{\ln(x)}{x} \, dx\\
&= \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_1^{\ln(b)} u \, du\\
&= \lim_{b \to \infty} \left( \frac{u^2}{2} \right)\biggm|_1^{\ln(b)}\\
&= \lim_{b \to \infty} \left( \frac{(\ln(b))^2}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \right)\\
&= \infty\text{.}
\end{align*}
So the improper integral \(\int_e^{\infty} \frac{\ln(x)}{x} \, dx\) diverges.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4077}{}\hypertarget{p-6342}{}%
We write the improper integral as a limit and use the substitution \(u = \ln(x)\) and \(du = \frac{1}{x} \ dx\) to revaluate the definite integral, then take the limit:.%
\begin{align*}
\int_e^{\infty} \frac{1}{x\ln(x)} \, dx  &= \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_e^{b} \frac{1}{x\ln(x)} \, dx\\
&= \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_1^{\ln(b)} \frac{1}{u} \, du\\

&= \lim_{b \to \infty} \left( \ln(\ln(|b|)) - \ln(1) \right)\\

\end{align*}
So the improper integral \(\int_e^{\infty} \frac{1}{x\ln(x)} \, dx\) diverges.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4078}{}\hypertarget{p-6343}{}%
We again write the improper integral as a limit and use the substitution \(u = \ln(x)\) and \(du = \frac{1}{x} \ dx\) to evaluate the definite integral, then take the limit:%
\begin{align*}
\int_e^{\infty} \frac{1}{x(\ln(x))^2} \, dx  &= \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_e^{b} \frac{1}{x(\ln(x))^2} \, dx\\
&= \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_1^{\ln(b)} \frac{1}{u^2} \, du\\
&= \lim_{b \to \infty} \left( -u^{-1} \right)\biggm|_1^{\ln(b)}\\
&= \lim_{b \to \infty} \left( -\frac{1}{\ln(b)} - (-1) \right)\\
&= 1\text{.}
\end{align*}
So the improper integral \(\int_e^{\infty} \frac{1}{x(\ln(x))^2} \, dx\) converges to \(1\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-4079}{}\hypertarget{p-6344}{}%
We again write the improper integral as a limit and use the substitution \(u = \ln(x)\) and \(du = \frac{1}{x} \ dx\) to rewrite the definite integral. If \(p=1\), then the integral diverges by part (b). If \(p \neq 1\), we have%
\begin{align*}
\int_e^{\infty} \frac{1}{x(\ln(x))^p} \, dx  &= \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_e^{b} \frac{1}{x(\ln(x))^p} \, dx\\
&= \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_1^{\ln(b)} \frac{1}{u^p} \, du\\
&= \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_1^{\ln(b)} u^{-p} \, du\\
&= \lim_{b \to \infty} \left( \frac{u^{-p+1}}{-p+1} \right)\biggm|_1^{\ln(b)}\\

&= 1\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6345}{}%
If \(p \lt 1\), then \(1-p \gt 0\) and%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{1-p} \lim_{b \to \infty} \left( (\ln(b))^{1-p} - 1 \right) = \left(\frac{1}{1-p}\right)\infty = \infty\text{.}
\end{equation*}
In this case the improper integral \(\int_e^{\infty} \frac{1}{x(\ln(x))^p} \, dx\) diverges.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6346}{}%
If \(p \gt 1\), then \(1-p \lt 0\) and%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{1-p}\lim_{b \to \infty} \left( (\ln(b))^{1-p} - 1 \right) = \frac{1}{1-p}\lim_{b \to \infty} \left( \frac{1}{(\ln(b))^{p-1}} - 1 \right)  = \left(\frac{1}{1-p}\right)(0-1) = \frac{1}{p-1}
\end{equation*}
In this case the improper integral \(\int_e^{\infty} \frac{1}{x(\ln(x))^p} \, dx\) converges to \(\frac{1}{p-1}\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6347}{}%
Thus, the improper integral \(\int_e^{\infty} \frac{1}{x(\ln(x))^p} \, dx\) diverges if \(p \leq 1\) and converges to \(\frac{1}{p-1}\) if \(p \gt 1\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-4080}{}\hypertarget{p-6348}{}%
This integral is improper since the integrand is undefined at \(x = 0\). So we write the improper integral as a limit, use the substitution \(u = \ln(x)\) and \(du = \frac{1}{x} \ dx\) to evaluate the definite integral, then take the limit:%
\begin{align*}
\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(x)}{x} \, dx  &= \lim_{a \to 0^+} \int_a^1 \frac{\ln(x)}{x} \, dx\\
&= \lim_{a \to 0^+} \int_{\ln(a)}^{0} u \, du\\
&= \lim_{a \to 0^+} \left( \frac{u^2}{2} \right)\biggm|_{\ln(a)}^{0}\\
&= \lim_{a \to 0^+} \left( -\frac{(\ln(a))^2}{2} \right)\\
&= -\infty\text{.}
\end{align*}
So the improper integral \(\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(x)}{x} \, dx\) diverges.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4081}{}\hypertarget{p-6349}{}%
This integral is improper since the integrand is undefined at \(x=0\). So we write the improper integral as a limit, then use parts with \(u = \ln(x)\), \(du = \frac{1}{x} \, dx\), \(dv = dx\), and \(v = x\) to evaluate the definite integral, then take the limit:%
\begin{align*}
\int_0^1 \ln(x) \, dx  &= \lim_{a \to 0^+} \int_a^1 \ln(x) \, dx\\
&= \lim_{a \to 0^+} \left( x\ln(x)\biggm|_a^1 - \int_{a}^{1} \ dx \right)\\
&= \lim_{a \to 0^+} \left( -a\ln(a) - x\biggm|_{\ln(a)}^{0} \right)\\
&= \lim_{a \to 0^+} \left( -a\ln(a) - (1-a) \right)\\
&= \lim_{a \to 0^+} \left( -a\ln(a) \right) - 1\text{.}
\end{align*}
The limit \(\lim_{a \to 0^+} \left( -a\ln(a) \right)\) has the form \(0 \times \infty\), which is indeterminate, so we need to rewrite it in a form in which we can apply L'Hopital's Rule. Now,%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{a \to 0^+} \left( -a\ln(a) \right) = \lim_{a \to 0^+} \left( \frac{-\ln(a)}{\frac{1}{a}} \right)\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and this latter limit is of the form \(\frac{\infty}{\infty}\). Applying L'Hopital's Rule gives us%
\begin{align*}
\lim_{a \to 0^+} \left( \frac{-\ln(a)}{\frac{1}{a}} \right)  &= \lim_{a \to 0^+} \left( \frac{-\frac{1}{a}}{-\frac{1}{a^2}} \right)\\
&= \lim_{a \to 0^+} a\\
&= 0
\end{align*}
Returning to our earlier established equality that%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^1 \ln(x) \, dx = \lim_{a \to 0^+} \left( -a\ln(a) \right) - 1\text{,}
\end{equation*}
this most recent limit shows that the improper integral \(\int_0^1 \ln(x) \, dx\) converges to \(-1\).%

How can we use definite integrals to measure the area between two curves?%

\end{objectives}
\hypertarget{p-6353}{}%
Early on in our work with the definite integral, we learned that for an object moving along an axis, the area under a non-negative velocity function \(v\) between \(a\) and \(b\) tells us the distance the object traveled on that time interval, and that area is given precisely by the definite integral \(\int_a^b v(t) \, dt\). In general, for any nonnegative function \(f\) on an interval \([a,b]\), \(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\) measures the area bounded by the curve and the \(x\)-axis between \(x = a\) and \(x = b\).%

In \hyperref[PA-6-1]{Example~\ref{PA-6-1}}, we saw a natural way to think about the area between two curves: it is the area beneath the upper curve minus the area below the lower curve.%

In \hyperref[F-6-1-PA1revisited]{Figure~\ref{F-6-1-PA1revisited}}, we see that the graphs intersect at \((0,2)\) and \((3,5)\). We can find these intersection points algebraically by solving the system of equations given by \(y = x+2\) and \(y = (x-1)^2 + 1\): substituting \(x+2\) for \(y\) in the second equation yields \(x+2 = (x-1)^2 + 1\), so \(x+2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 + 1\), and thus%
\begin{equation*}
x^2 - 3x = x(x-3) = 0\text{,}
\end{equation*}
from which it follows that \(x = 0\) or \(x = 3\). Using \(y = x+2\), we find the corresponding \(y\)-values of the intersection points.%

\int_0^3 (x+2) \, dx = \frac{21}{2}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
while the area under \(f\) on the same interval is%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^3 [(x-1)^2 + 1] \, dx = 6\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6368}{}%
Thus, the area between the curves is%
\begin{equation}
A = \int_0^3 (x+2) \, dx -  \int_0^3 [(x-1)^2 + 1] \, dx = \frac{21}{2} - 6 = \frac{9}{2}\text{.}\label{E-DiffOfInt}
\end{equation}
%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-6369}{}%
We can also think of the area this way: if we slice up the region between two curves into thin vertical rectangles (in the same spirit as we originally sliced the region between a single curve and the \(x\)-axis in \hyperref[sec-4-2-Riemann]{Section~\ref{sec-4-2-Riemann}}), we see (as shown in \hyperref[F-6-1-PA1revisited2]{Figure~\ref{F-6-1-PA1revisited2}}) that the height of a typical rectangle is given by the difference between the two functions, \(g(x) - f(x)\), and its width is \(\Delta x\). Thus the area of the rectangle is%
\begin{equation*}
A_{\text{rect} } = (g(x) - f(x)) \Delta x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/6_1_PA1revisited2.pdf}
\caption{On the left is an example of a rectangular vertical slice. The right figure shows the area bounded by the functions \(f(x) = (x-1)^2 + 1\) and \(g(x) = x+2\) on the interval \([0,3]\).\label{F-6-1-PA1revisited2}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-6370}{}%
The area between the two curves on \([0,3]\) is thus approximated by the Riemann sum%
\begin{equation*}
A \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n} (g(x_i) - f(x_i)) \Delta x\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and as we let \(n \to \infty\), it follows that the area is given by the single definite integral%
\begin{equation}
A = \int_0^3 (g(x) - f(x)) \, dx\text{.}\label{E-IntOfDiff}
\end{equation}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6371}{}%
We will see this strategy many times in the following sections: take a ``representative slice'', approximate its area in terms of \(\Delta x\), sum them up, and then take a limit. When we do so, the sum will change to an integral and \(\Delta x\) will turn into a \(dx\). Here, the integral sums the areas of thin rectangles.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6372}{}%
Finally, it doesn't matter whether we think of the area between two curves as the difference between the area bounded by the individual curves (as in~\hyperref[E-DiffOfInt]{(\ref{E-DiffOfInt})}) or as the limit of a Riemann sum of the areas of thin rectangles between the curves (as in~\hyperref[E-IntOfDiff]{(\ref{E-IntOfDiff})}). These two results are the same, since the difference of two integrals is the integral of the difference:%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^3 g(x) \, dx -  \int_0^3 f(x) \, dx = \int_0^3 (g(x) - f(x)) \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}

\subsection[{Finding Area with Horizontal Slices}]{Finding Area with Horizontal Slices}\label{subsection-162}
\hypertarget{p-6399}{}%
At times, the shape of a region may dictate that we use horizontal rectangular slices, instead of vertical ones.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-258}
\hypertarget{p-6400}{}%
Find the area of the region bounded by the parabola \(x = y^2 - 1\) and the line \(y = x-1\), shown at left in \hyperref[F-6-1-IntWRTy]{Figure~\ref{F-6-1-IntWRTy}}.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/6_1_IntWRTy.pdf}
\caption{The area bounded by the functions \(x = y^2-1\) and \(y = x-1\) (at left), with the region sliced vertically (center) and horizontally (at right).\label{F-6-1-IntWRTy}}
\end{figure}
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-341}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-6401}{}%
By solving the second equation for \(x\) and writing \(x = y + 1\), we find that \(y+1 = y^2 - 1\). Hence the curves intersect where \(y^2 - y - 2 = 0\). Thus, we find \(y = -1\) or \(y = 2\), so the intersection points of the two curves are \((0,-1)\) and \((3,2)\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6402}{}%
If we attempt to use vertical rectangles to slice up the area (as in the center graph of \hyperref[F-6-1-IntWRTy]{Figure~\ref{F-6-1-IntWRTy}}), we see that from \(x = -1\) to \(x = 0\) the curves that bound the top and bottom of the rectangle are one and the same, which could make the integral difficult. This suggests, as shown in the rightmost graph in the figure, that we try using horizontal rectangles.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6403}{}%
Note that the width (horizontal distance) of a horizontal rectangle depends on \(y\). Between \(y = -1\) and \(y = 2\), the right end of a representative rectangle is determined by the line \(x = y+1\), and the left end is determined by the parabola, \(x = y^2-1\). The thickness (vertical distance) of the rectangle is \(\Delta y\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6404}{}%
Therefore, the area of the rectangle is%
\begin{equation*}
A_{\text{rect} } = [(y+1) - (y^2-1)] \Delta y\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and the area between the two curves on the \(y\)-interval \([-1,2]\) is approximated by the Riemann sum%
\begin{equation*}
A \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n} [(y_i+1)-(y_i^2-1)] \Delta y\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6405}{}%
Taking the limit of the Riemann sum, it follows that the area of the region is%
\begin{equation}
A = \int_{y=-1}^{y=2} [(y+1) - (y^2-1)] \, dy\text{.}\label{E-IntWRTy}
\end{equation}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6406}{}%
We emphasize that we are integrating with respect to \(y\); this is because we chose to use horizontal rectangles whose widths depend on \(y\) and whose thickness is denoted \(\Delta y\). It is a straightforward exercise to evaluate the integral in \hyperref[E-IntWRTy]{Equation~(\ref{E-IntWRTy})} and find that \(A = \frac{9}{2}\).%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-6407}{}%
Just as with the use of vertical rectangles of thickness \(\Delta x\), we have a general principle for finding the area between two curves, which we state as follows.%
\begin{assemblage}[Area Between Two Curves Using Horizontal Slices]\label{assemblage-134}
\hypertarget{p-6408}{}%
If two curves \(x = g(y)\) and \(x = f(y)\) intersect at \((g(c),c)\) and \((g(d),d)\), and \(g(y) \ge f(y)\) on the interval \([c,d]\), then the area between the curves is%
\begin{equation*}

A careful plot of the region shows that the two curves, together with the \(x\)-axis, form a roughly triangular region with the \(x\)-axis as the base, \(y=x^2\) as the left ``side'', and \(y = 2-x\) as the right side. Using horizontal slices, and writing each respective equation with \(x\) as a function of \(y\) (so \(x=\sqrt{y}\) and \(x=2-y\)), we find that the area of this region is%
\begin{equation*}
A=\int_{y=0}^{y=1} \left((2-y) - \sqrt{y} \right) \, dy = \\

For \(0 \le y \le 3\), we observe that \(g(y)=y \ge y^2-2y = f(y)\), so using horizontal slices and the corresponding definite integral, we find that the region's area is%

A = \int_{0}^{3} (y - (y^2 - 2y)) \, dy = \int_{0}^{3} (3y - y^2) \, dy = \frac{9}{2}\text{.}

\subsection[{Finding the Length of a Curve}]{Finding the Length of a Curve}\label{subsection-163}
\index{arc length}\hypertarget{p-6433}{}%
We can also use the definite integral to find the length of a portion of a curve. We use the same fundamental principle: we slice the curve up into small pieces whose lengths we can easily approximate. Specifically, we subdivide the curve into small approximating line segments, as shown at left in \hyperref[F-6-1-ArcLength]{Figure~\ref{F-6-1-ArcLength}}.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/6_1_ArcLength.pdf}
\caption{At left, a continuous function \(y = f(x)\) whose length we seek on the interval \(a = x_0\) to \(b = x_3\).  At right, a close up view of a portion of the curve.\label{F-6-1-ArcLength}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-6434}{}%
We estimate the length \(L_{\text{slice} }\) of each portion of the curve on a small interval of length \(\Delta x\). We use the right triangle with legs parallel to the coordinate axes and hypotenuse connecting the endpoints of the slice, as seen at right in \hyperref[F-6-1-ArcLength]{Figure~\ref{F-6-1-ArcLength}}. The length, \(h\), of the hypotenuse approximates the length, \(L_{\text{slice} }\), of the curve between the two selected points. Thus,%
\begin{equation*}
L_{\text{slice} } \approx h = \sqrt{ (\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2 }\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6435}{}%
Next we use algebra to rearrange the expression for the length of the hypotenuse into a form that we can integrate. By removing a factor of \((\Delta x)^2\), we find%
\begin{align*}
L_{\text{slice}} &\approx  \sqrt{ (\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2 }\\
&= \sqrt{ (\Delta x)^2\left(1 + \frac{(\Delta y)^2}{(\Delta x)^2} \right)}\\
&= \sqrt{1 + \frac{(\Delta y)^2}{(\Delta x)^2} } \cdot \Delta x\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6436}{}%
Then, as \(n \to \infty\) and \(\Delta x \to 0\), we have that \(\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} \to \frac{dy}{dx} = f'(x)\). Thus, we can say that%
\begin{equation*}
L_{\text{slice} } \approx \sqrt{1 + f'(x)^2} \Delta x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6437}{}%
Taking a Riemann sum of all of these slices and letting \(n \to \infty\), we arrive at the following fact.%
\begin{assemblage}[Arc Length]\label{assemblage-135}

Given a differentiable function \(f\) on an interval \([a,b]\), the total arc length, \index{arc length} \(L\), along the curve \(y = f(x)\) from \(x = a\) to \(x = b\) is given by%

Find the position of the particle when \(t = 4\) sec, assuming that when \(t = 0\), the particle's location is \((0,f(0))\).%

Using the formula for arc length, we know%
\begin{equation*}
L = \int_{-1}^{1} \sqrt{1+(2x)^2} \,dx\text{.}

Evaluating the integral, we find \(L \approx 2.95789\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-4153}{}\hypertarget{p-6459}{}%
The curve is a semi-circle of radius 2, so its length must be \(L = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 \pi r = 2\pi\). This is confirmed by the arc length formula, since \(f(x) = \sqrt{4-x^2}\), so \(f'(x) = \frac{1}{2}(4-x^2)^{-1/2}(-2x)\)%
\begin{equation*}
L = \int_{-2}^{2} \sqrt{1 + \left(-x(4-x^2)^{-1/2} \right)^2} \, dx = \int_{-2}^{2} \sqrt{1 + x^2(4-x^2)^{-1}} \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
It follows\footnote{This integral is actually improper because the integrand is undefined at the endpoints, \(x = \pm 2\). We learned how to evaluate such integrals in \hyperref[sec-5-10-improper]{Section~\ref{sec-5-10-improper}}.\label{fn-67}} that%
\begin{equation*}
L = \int_{-2}^{2} \sqrt{\frac{4}{4-x^2}} \, dx = 2\pi\text{.}

\begin{equation*}
(y')^2 = e^{6x}(9x^2 + 6x + 1)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Thus, the arc length of the curve on \([0,1]\) is%
\begin{equation*}
L = \int_0^1 \sqrt{1 + e^{6x}(9x^2 + 6x + 1)} \, dx \approx 20.1773\text{.}

Because \(\sqrt{1+f'(x)^2}\) will rarely simplify nicely and rarely have an elementary antiderivative, we will usually have to estimate the value of \(\int_a^b \sqrt{1+f'(x)^2} \, dx\) using computational technology.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4156}{}\hypertarget{p-6462}{}%
After 4 seconds traveling at 7 cm/sec, the particle has moved 28 cm. So, we have to find the value of \(b\) for which the arc length \(L\) along \([0,b]\) is 28. Thus, we know that%
\begin{equation*}
28 = L = \int_0^b \sqrt{1 + (0.2x)^2} \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Rewriting the integral, we see%
\begin{equation*}
28 = \int_0^b \sqrt{1+0.4x^2} \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Experimenting with different values of \(b\) in a computational engine like Wolfram|Alpha, we find that for \(b \approx 9.011\), \(\int_0^{9.011} \sqrt{1+0.4x^2} \, dx \approx 27.9992\), and thus the position of the particle when \(t=4\) is approximately \((9.011,f(9.011)) = (9.011, 9.1198)\).%
\end{enumerate}
%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-6463}{}%
The same technique can be applied to parametric curves. For now consider a curve \((x(t), y(t))\) travelling in just two dimensions (but see \hyperref[Ex-3D-Curve]{Example~\ref{Ex-3D-Curve}} for curves in 3D). As before, the length of a small segment will be \(\sqrt{(\Delta x)^2+(\Delta y)^2}\), but here we will factor out \(\Delta t\) to get:%
\begin{equation*}
L_{slice}\approx \sqrt{\left(\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} \right)^2+\left(\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t} \right)^2} \cdot \Delta t
\end{equation*}
Now, taking the limit as \(\Delta t \rightarrow 0 \), \(\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}\) and \(\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t}\) turn into \(\frac{dx}{dt}\) and \(\frac{dy}{dt}\), so the length of the segment is%
\begin{equation*}
L=\int_{t=a}^{t=b} \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2+\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2}\, dt  \text{.}

The point of intersection of the graphs occurs when \(y(y - 2) = -(y - 1)(y - 3)\), and thus we need to find where \(y^2 - 2y = -(y^2 - 4y + 3)\) or \(2y^2 - 6y + 3 = 0\). By the quadratic formula, it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
y = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{(-6)^2 - (4)(2)(3)}}{(2)(2)} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 24}}{4} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{12}}{4} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{3}}{2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Since the curve \(x = -(y - 1)(y - 3)\) lies to the right (has a greater \(x\) value) of \(x = y(y - 2)\) between \(y = \frac{3 - \sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.63\) and \(y = \frac{3 + \sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 2.37\) as shown in the figure below, we see that the area between the two curves is given by the integral%
\begin{equation*}
\int_{\frac{3 - \sqrt{3}}{2}}^{\frac{3 + \sqrt{3}}{2}} -(y - 1)(y - 3) - y(y - 2) \ dy\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Evaluating this integral, we find that%
\begin{align*}

We can rewrite \(y = 2x - 1\) as \(x = \frac{y+1}{2}\). The two curves intersect when \(y^2 - y - 2 = \frac{y+1}{2}\). It follows that \(2y^2 - 2y - 4 = y+1\), so \(2y^2 - 3y - 5 = 0\) and thus factoring, \((2y-5)(y+1) = 0\). Hence the two curves intersect when \(y = -1\) or \(y = \frac{5}{2}\). The figure below shows that \(x = \frac{y+1}{2}\) lies to the right of \(x = y^2 - y - 2\)on this interval, so the area of the region between the two curves is%

Let \(f(x) = 1-x^2\) and \(g(x) = ax^2 - a\), where \(a\) is an unknown positive real number. For what value(s) of \(a\) is the area between the curves \(f\) and \(g\) equal to 2?%
\par\smallskip
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Answer.}\hypertarget{answer-301}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-6504}{}%
\(a = \frac{1}{2}\).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-348}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-6505}{}%
Both of these quadratic functions pass through the points \((-1,0)\) and \((1,0)\), and thus these are the two intersection points for all positive values of \(a\). In addition, since \(1 - x^2 \gt ax^2 - a\) on \(-1 \lt x \lt 1\), it follows that the area between the curves is given by%
\begin{equation*}
A = \int_{-1}^{1} \left( 1 - x^2 - (ax^2 - a) \right) \, dx = \int_{-1}^{1} \left( (1+a) - (1+a)x^2 \right) \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Evaluating the integral, we find that%
\begin{align*}
A &= \int_{-1}^{1} \left( 1 + a - (1+a)x^2 \right) \, dx\\
&= \left. (1+a)x - \frac{1+a}{3}x^3 \right|_{-1}^{1}\\
&= (1+a)(1) - \frac{1+a}{3}(1)^3 - \left( (1+a)(-1) - \frac{1+a}{3}(-1)^3 \right)\\
&= 2(1+a) - \frac{2(1+a)}{3}\\
&= \frac{4(1+a)}{3}\text{.}
\end{align*}
We want to know for which value(s) of \(a\) it follows that \(A = 2\). Thus, we solve%
\begin{equation*}
2 = \frac{4(1+a)}{3}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
from which it follows that \(a = \frac{1}{2}\). Hence, in the figure below, the area between the two curves is exactly \(A = 2\).%

The answer is yes. Let \(AV\) is the average value of a function \(f\) on an interval \([a,b]\). By the definition of average value,%
\begin{equation*}
AV(b-a) = \int_a^b f(x) \ dx\text{,}
\end{equation*}
which can also be viewed as the area of the rectangle with base \((b-a)\) and height \(AV\). Now suppose that the area of the region above the graph of \(f\) and below the line \(y=AV\) on the interval \([a,b]\) is \(R_1\) and the area of the region below the graph of \(f\) and above the line \(y=AV\) on the interval \([a,b]\) is \(R_2\). The figure below illustrates that the value of the definite integral is the area of the rectangle plus the area above the rectangle minus the area below the rectangle, or%
\begin{equation*}
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = AV(b-a) + R_2 - R_1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Having already established that \(AV(b-a) = \int_a^b f(x) \ dx\), it follows that \(R_2 - R_1 = 0\). So the area of the region that lies below \(y = f(x)\) and above \(y = AV\) is equal to the amount of area that lies below \(y = AV\) and above \(y = f(x)\) on \([a,b]\).%

\hypertarget{p-6555}{}%
In the previous section, we saw that the way we find area of a 2D region is to slice it into thin rectangles, and then integrate the height of the rectangles. The same principle lets us find the volume of a 3D shape: slice it into thin ``cross-sections'', and then integrate the area of the cross-sections. So while the formula for area is%
\begin{equation*}
\text{Area}= \int_a^b f(x)\, dx
\end{equation*}
where \(f(x) \) is the height of a rectangle at \(x \), \(dx \) is the width of the rectangle, and \(a \) and \(b \) are the endpoints of the interval , the formula for volume is%
\begin{equation*}
\text{Volume}= \int_a^b A(x)\, dx
\end{equation*}
where \(A(x) \) is the area of the cross-section at \(x \), \(dx \) is the width, and \(a \) and \(b \) are the endpoints of the interval. In \hyperref[PA-6-2]{Example~\ref{PA-6-2}}, we saw that the cross-sections were circles, so we used the circle area formula to get \(A(x)=\pi r^2=\pi (-\frac 35 x +3)^2\), and integrated from \(x=0\) to \(x=5\) since those corresponded to the  top and bottom of the cone.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6556}{}%
As we saw in the previous section, for 2D shapes it is sometimes more convenient to integrate with respect to \(y\) instead of \(x\). The same is true for 3D shapes. In fact, one may want to integrate with respect to \(x\), \(y\), or \(z\), and you should try to choose the variable of integration so that all of your cross-sections are the same shape. For instance, in \hyperref[PA-6-2]{Example~\ref{PA-6-2}}, we integrated with respect to \(x\) so that the cross-sections were all circles. If we had taken slices in another direction, the area of a cross-section would have been much more complicated and the integral would have been much harder!%

\index{solid of revolution}\hypertarget{p-6614}{}%
A solid of revolution is a three dimensional solid that can be generated by revolving one or more curves around a fixed axis. For example, the circular cone in \hyperref[F-PA-6-2]{Figure~\ref{F-PA-6-2}} is the solid of revolution generated by revolving the portion of the line \(y = 3 - \frac{3}{5}x\) from \(x = 0\) to \(x = 5\) about the \(x\)-axis. Notice that if we slice a solid of revolution perpendicular to the axis of revolution, the resulting cross-section is a circle.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6615}{}%
We first consider solids whose slices are thin cylinders. Recall that the volume of a cylinder is given by \(V = \pi r^2 h\).%
\begin{example}[]\label{Ex-6-2-Disks}
\hypertarget{p-6616}{}%
Find the volume of the solid of revolution generated when the region \(R\) bounded by \(y = 4-x^2\) and the \(x\)-axis is revolved about the \(x\)-axis.%

\hypertarget{p-6617}{}%
First, we observe that \(y = 4-x^2\) intersects the \(x\)-axis at the points \((-2,0)\) and \((2,0)\). When we revolve the region \(R\) about the \(x\)-axis, we get the three-dimensional solid pictured in \hyperref[F-6-2-Ex1]{Figure~\ref{F-6-2-Ex1}}.%

\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-6618}{}%
We slice the solid into vertical slices of thickness \(\Delta x\) between \(x = -2\) and \(x = 2\). A representative slice is a cylinder of height \(\Delta x\) and radius \(4-x^2\). Hence, the volume of the slice is%
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{slice} } = \pi (4-x^2)^2 \Delta x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6619}{}%
Using a definite integral to sum the volumes of the representative slices, it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
V = \int_{-2}^{2} \pi (4-x^2)^2 \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6620}{}%
It is straightforward to evaluate the integral and find that the volume is \(V = \frac{512}{15}\pi\).%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-6621}{}%
For a solid such as the one in \hyperref[Ex-6-2-Disks]{Example~\ref{Ex-6-2-Disks}}, where each slice is a cylindrical disk, we first find the volume of a typical slice (noting particularly how this volume depends on \(x\)), and then integrate over the range of \(x\)-values that bound the solid. Often, we will be content with simply finding the integral that represents the volume; if we desire a numeric value for the integral, we typically use a calculator or computer algebra system to find that value.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6622}{}%
This method for finding the volume of a solid of revolution is often called the \emph{disk method}. \index{disk method}%
\begin{assemblage}[The Disk Method]\label{assemblage-137}
\hypertarget{p-6623}{}%
If \(y = r(x)\) is a nonnegative continuous function on \([a,b]\), then the volume of the solid of revolution generated by revolving the curve about the \(x\)-axis over this interval is given by%

First, we must determine where the curves \(y = 4-x^2\) and \(y = x+2\) intersect. Substituting the expression for \(y\) from the second equation into the first equation, we find that \(x + 2 = 4-x^2\). Rearranging, it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
x^2 + x - 2 = 0\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and the solutions to this equation are \(x = -2\) and \(x = 1\). The curves therefore cross at \((-2,0)\) and \((1,1)\).%

\hypertarget{p-6627}{}%
When we revolve the region \(R\) about the \(x\)-axis, we get the three-dimensional solid pictured at left in \hyperref[F-6-2-Ex2]{Figure~\ref{F-6-2-Ex2}}.%

\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-6628}{}%
Immediately we see a major difference between the solid in this example and the one in \hyperref[Ex-6-2-Disks]{Example~\ref{Ex-6-2-Disks}}: here, the three-dimensional solid of revolution isn't ``solid'' because it has open space in its center along the axis of revolution. If we slice the solid perpendicular to the axis of revolution, we observe that the resulting slice is not a solid disk, but rather a \emph{washer}, as pictured at right in \hyperref[F-6-2-Ex2]{Figure~\ref{F-6-2-Ex2}}. At a given location \(x\) between \(x = -2\) and \(x = 1\), the small radius \(r(x)\) of the inner circle is determined by the curve \(y = x+2\), so \(r(x) = x+2\). Similarly, the big radius \(R(x)\) comes from the function \(y = 4-x^2\), and thus \(R(x) = 4-x^2\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6629}{}%
To find the volume of a representative slice, we compute the volume of the outer disk and subtract the volume of the inner disk. Since%
\begin{equation*}
\pi R(x)^2 \Delta x - \pi r(x)^2 \Delta x = \pi [ R(x)^2 - r(x)^2] \Delta x\text{,}
\end{equation*}
it follows that the volume of a typical slice is%
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{slice} } = \pi [ (4-x^2)^2 - (x+2)^2 ] \Delta x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6630}{}%
Using a definite integral to sum the volumes of the respective slices across the integral, we find that%
\begin{equation*}
V = \int_{-2}^1 \pi[ (4-x^2)^2 - (x+2)^2 ] \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6631}{}%
Evaluating the integral, we find that the volume of the solid of revolution is \(V = \frac{108}{5}\pi\).%

Note that the slices are cylindrical washers only if taken perpendicular to the \(y\)-axis. We slice the solid horizontally, starting at \(y = 0\) and proceeding up to \(y = 1\). The thickness of a representative slice is \(\Delta y\), so we must express the integrand in terms of \(y\). The inner radius is determined by the curve \(y = \sqrt{x}\), so we solve for \(x\) and get \(x = y^2 = r(y)\). In the same way, we solve the curve \(y = x^4\) (which governs the outer radius) for \(x\) in terms of \(y\), and hence \(x = \sqrt[4]{y}\). Therefore, the volume of a typical slice is%
\begin{equation*}

Observe that horizontal slices with thickness \(\Delta y\) are all cylindrical disks, each with radius given by \(r(y) = y^2\) since they are given by the curve \(y = \sqrt{x}\), which can be equivalently expressed as \(x = y^2\). The volume of each slice is thus%

Slicing perpendicular to the axis of rotation, we get slices of thickness \(\Delta y\) that are shaped like washers. The outer radius, \(R(y)\), is given by \(R(y) = 4\); the innner radius is given by the function \(y = \sqrt{x}\), but expressed with \(x\) as a function of \(y\), so \(r(y) = y^2\). It follows that a representative washer slice has volume%
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{slice}} = \pi (R(y)^2 - r(y)^2) \Delta y = \pi (16 - y^4) \Delta y\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Further, since \(y = \sqrt{x}\) and \(x = 4\) intersect at the point \((4,2)\), we integrate from \(y = 0\) to \(y = 2\) and thus find that the total volume is%
\begin{equation*}
V = \int_0^2 \pi (16 - y^4) \, dy\text{.}

The curves \(y=x^3\) and \(y=2x\) intersect where \(x^3 = 2x\), so where \(x^3-2x = x(x^2 - 2) = 0\). The two nonnegative values of \(x\) that make this equation true are \(x=0\) and \(x=\sqrt{2}\), and thus the points \((0,0)\) and \((\sqrt{2}, 2\sqrt{2})\) form the boundaries of the region \(S\) that is being rotated about the \(x\)-axis. Since we rotate about the horizontal axis, we slice perpendicular to that axis with slices of thickness \(\Delta x\). A representative slice is in the shape of a washer and has volume%
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{slice}} = \pi (R(x)^2 - r(x)^2) \Delta x = \pi ( (2x)^2 - (x^3)^2 ) \Delta x\text{,}

To use the same region \(S\) as in part (c), but now revolved about the \(y\)-axis, we shift to horizontal slices of thickness \(\Delta y\), and thus need to express the curves as functions of \(y\): the rightmost curve is \(x = R(y) = \sqrt[3]{y}\), while the leftmost curve is \(x = r(y) = \frac{1}{2}y\). A representative slice is a washer whose volume is%
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{slice}} = \pi (R(y)^2 - r(y)^2) \Delta y = \pi( (\sqrt[3]{y})^2 - (\frac{1}{2}y)^2) \Delta y\text{.}

For this pair of curves, we see they intersect where \(x=(y-1)^2\) and \(x = (y+1)\) are both true, and hence where \((y-1)^2 = y+1\). Expanding, moving all terms to the left, and combining like terms, we see that \(y^2 - 2y + 1 = y + 1\), so \(y^2 - 3y = 0\). It follows that \(y(y-3) = 0\) and therefore \(y=3\) or \(y = 0\). Plotting the region and revolving about the \(y\)-axis, we see that horizontal slices of thickness \(\Delta y\) are shaped like washers. The outer radius is given by \(R(y) = y+1\), while the inner radius is \(r(y) = (y-1)^2\). A representative slice thus has volume%
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{slice}} = \pi (R(y)^2 - r(y)^2) \Delta y = \pi( (y+1)^2 - ((y-1)^2)^2 ) \Delta y\text{.}
\end{equation*}
The volume of the solid of revolution is therefore%
\begin{equation*}
V = \int_0^3 \pi( (y+1)^2 - (y-1)^4 ) \, dy\text{.}

It is possible to revolve a region around any horizontal or vertical line. Doing so adjusts the radii of the cylinders or washers involved by a constant value. A careful, well-labeled plot of the solid of revolution will usually reveal how the different axis of revolution affects the definite integral.%
\begin{example}[]\label{Ex-6-2-AboutNotY}
\hypertarget{p-6689}{}%
Find the volume of the solid of revolution generated when the finite region \(S\) that lies between \(y = x^2\) and \(y = x\) is revolved about the line \(y = -1\).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-360}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-6690}{}%
Graphing the region between the two curves in the first quadrant between their points of intersection (\((0,0)\) and \((1,1)\)) and then revolving the region about the line \(y = -1\), we see the solid shown in \hyperref[F-6-2-Ex4]{Figure~\ref{F-6-2-Ex4}}. Each slice of the solid perpendicular to the axis of revolution is a washer, and the radii of each washer are governed by the curves \(y = x^2\) and \(y = x\). But we also see that there is one added change: the axis of revolution adds a fixed length to each radius. The inner radius of a typical slice, \(r(x)\), is given by \(r(x) = x^2 + 1\), while the outer radius is \(R(x) = x+1\).%

\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-6691}{}%
Therefore, the volume of a typical slice is%
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{slice} } = \pi[ R(x)^2 - r(x)^2 ] \Delta x = \pi \left[ (x+1)^2 - (x^2 + 1)^2 \right] \Delta x\text{.}

%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6692}{}%
Finally, we integrate to find the total volume, and%

V = \int_0^1  \pi \left[ (x+1)^2 - (x^2 + 1)^2 \right] \, dx = \frac{7}{15} \pi\text{.}

The two curves intersect in the first quadrant at \((0,0)\) and \((\sqrt{2}, 2\sqrt{2})\). Revolving the region \(S\) about the line \(y = -2\), we see that a typical slice is a washer with thickness \(\Delta x\), outer radius \(R(x) = 2x + 2\), and inner radius \(r(x) = x^3 + 2\). It follows by the washer method that%
\begin{equation*}
V = \int_{0}^{\sqrt{2}} \pi ( (2x+2)^2 - (x^3 + 2)^2 ) \, dx = \frac{4}{21}(21+8\sqrt{2}) \pi \approx 19.336\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-4313}{}\hypertarget{p-6710}{}%
In this situation, revolving about \(y = 4\), we see that the outer radius of a typical washer is \(R(x) = 4 - x^3\), while the inner radius is \(r(x) = 4 - 2x\), and thus the volume is%
\begin{equation*}
V = \int_{0}^{\sqrt{2}} \pi ( (4 - x^3)^2 - (4-2x)^2 ) \, dx =  \left( 8-\frac{32\sqrt{2}}{21} \right)\pi \approx 18.3626\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-4314}{}\hypertarget{p-6711}{}%
Because we are revolving about \(x = -1\), when we slice perpendicular to this we get washers of thickness \(\Delta y\), and thus we need to write the two curves as functions of \(y\) in order to determine the radii of the slices as functions of \(y\), we note that the line can be expressed as \(x = \frac{1}{2}y\) and the cubic curve can be rewritten in the form \(x = y^{1/3}\). The outer radius of a typical slice is thus \(R(y) = y^{1/3} + 1\) and the inner radius is \(r(y) = \frac{1}{2}y + 1\). It follows that the volume of the solid is%
\begin{equation*}
V = \int_{0}^{2\sqrt{2}} \pi( (y^{1/3} + 1)^2 - (\frac{1}{2}y + 1)^2 ) \, dy = \frac{2}{15}(15 + 8\sqrt{2}) \pi \approx 11.022\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-4315}{}\hypertarget{p-6712}{}%
Here, the outer radius is \(R(y) = 5 - \frac{1}{2}y\) and the inner radius is \(r(y) = 5 - y^{1/3}\), so the total volume of the solid is%
\begin{equation*}
V = \int_{0}^{2\sqrt{2}} \pi( (5 - \frac{1}{2}y)^2 - (5 - y^{1/3})^2 ) \, dy = \frac{2}{15}(75-8\sqrt{2})\pi \approx 26.677\text{.}

\item{}\hypertarget{p-6714}{}%
A definite integral may be used to represent the volume of a solid. The idea is to slice the solid into thin shapes whose volume is easy to calculate. The volume of each slice is found by taking the area of the cross-section and multiplying it by the width. Summing up the volumes of the slices and taking the limit as the width \(\rightarrow 0 \) results in an integral representing the volume.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-6715}{}%
A three-dimensional solid of revolution  results from revolving a two-dimensional region about a particular axis or line called the \emph{axis of revolution}. We can use a definite integral to find the volume of such a solid  by taking slices perpendicular to the axis of revolution. The slices  will be circular disks or washers.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-6716}{}%
If we revolve about a horizontal line and slice perpendicular to that line, then our slices are vertical and of thickness \(\Delta x\). This leads us to integrate with respect to \(x\).%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-6717}{}%
If we revolve about a vertical line and slice perpendicular to that line, then our slices are horizontal and of thickness \(\Delta y\). This leads us to integrate with respect to \(y\).%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-6718}{}%
If we revolve about a line other than the \(x\)- or \(y\)-axis, we need to carefully account for the shift that occurs in the radius of a typical slice. Normally, this shift involves taking a sum or difference of the function along with the constant connected to the equation for the horizontal or vertical line; a well-labeled diagram is usually the best way to decide the new expression for the radius.%

To apply the formula we developed for arc length, we need the derivative of \(f\). By the chain rule, \(f'(x) = -3 \sin(\frac{x^3}{4}) \cdot \frac{3}{4}x^2\), so the arc length of \(f\) that lies along the upper boundary of \(R\) is%
\begin{equation*}
L = \int_0^{1.84257} \sqrt{1+\left( -3 \sin \left(\frac{x^3}{4}\right) \cdot \frac{3}{4}x^2 \right)^2} \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Using technology to evaluate the integral, we find \(L \approx 4.10521\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-4330}{}\hypertarget{p-6732}{}%
The area of \(R\) is%
\begin{equation*}
A = \int_0^{1.84527} 3 \cos\left( \frac{x^3}{4} \right) \, dx \approx 4.6623\text{.}
\end{equation*}

\item\hypertarget{li-4331}{}\hypertarget{p-6733}{}%
Revolving \(R\) around the \(x\)-axis, we can use the disk method with slices perpendicular to the \(x\)-axis to find the volume of the resulting region. Noting that the radius of each such disk is \(r(x) = 3 \cos(\frac{x^3}{4})\) and the width of each such disk is \(\triangle x\), we know the volume of each slice is%
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{slice}} \approx \pi r(x)^2 \triangle x = \pi \left( 3 \cos\left( \frac{x^3}{4} \right) \right)^2 \triangle x
\end{equation*}
and thus the total volume is%
\begin{equation*}
V = \int_0^{1.84527} \pi \cdot 9 \cos^2 \left( \frac{x^3}{4} \right) \, dx \approx 40.31965
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-4332}{}\hypertarget{p-6734}{}%
If we instead revolve \(R\) around the \(y\)-axis, we need to use horizontal disks of thickness \(\triangle y\) in order to apply the disk method. To do that, we also need to express \(x\) as a function of \(y\), rather than \(y\) as a function of \(x\) as given. Thus we take the given function \(y = 3 \cos(\frac{x^3}{4})\) and solve the equation for \(x\). First, we observe%
\begin{equation*}
\cos\left( \frac{x^3}{4} \right) = \frac{y}{3}
\end{equation*}
and thus using the inverse cosine,%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{x^3}{4} = \arccos \left( \frac{y}{3} \right)
\end{equation*}
and therefore \(x^3 = 4\arccos \left(\frac{y}{3} \right)\) so that%
\begin{equation*}
x = \sqrt[3]{4\arccos \left(\frac{y}{3} \right)}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Now, a typical slice has radius \(r(y) = \sqrt[3]{4\arccos \left(\frac{y}{3} \right)}\) with thickness \(\triangle y\), and volume%
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{slice}} \approx \pi \cdot \left( \sqrt[3]{4\arccos \left(\frac{y}{3} \right)} \right)^2 \triangle y\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Integrating to add up the slices from \(y = 0\) to \(y = 3\), we have the volume of the solid of revolution is%
\begin{equation*}
V = \int_0^3 \pi \left( 4\arccos \left(\frac{y}{3} \right) \right)^{2/3} \, dy \approx 23.29194\text{.}

See the sketch above. The exact intersection point of the curves is where \(\cos(x) = \sin(x)\) in the first quadrant, and thus at the point \((\frac{\pi}{4}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-4346}{}\hypertarget{p-6750}{}%
The area of \(R\) is given by the definite integral%
\begin{equation*}
A = \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}} ( \cos(x) - \sin(x) ) \, dx\text{.}

\item\hypertarget{li-4347}{}\hypertarget{p-6751}{}%
Revolving \(R\) about the \(x\)-axis and using slices perpendicular to the axis with thickness \(\triangle x\), the outer radius of the resulting washers is \(R(x) = \cos(x)\), while the inner radius of the washers is \(r(x) = \sin(x)\). The volume of a typical slice is%
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{slice}} \approx \pi (\cos^2(x) - \sin^2(x)) \triangle x
\end{equation*}
and thus using an integral to sum the slices over the interval \(x = 0\) to \(x = \pi/4\), we find the volume of the solid is%
\begin{equation*}
V = \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}} \pi (\cos^2(x) - \sin^2(x)) \, dx\text{.}

Revolving \(R\) about the \(y\)-axis, the resulting figure has solid cross-sections that are disks perpendicular to the \(y\)-axis with thickness \(\triangle x\), but the radius \(R(y)\) that governs the radius of each disk changes at the height where \(y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\) in the interval from \(y = 0\) to \(y = 1\). We also need to express the two curves that bound the region with \(x\) as a function of \(y\). On the interval from \(y = 0\) to \(y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\), the sine function provides the boundary, which we write as \(x = \arcsin(y)\); on the interval from \(y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\) to \(y = 1\), the cosine function provides the boundary, which we write as \(x = \arccos(y)\). On the lower interval, a typical slice has volume%
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{slice}} \approx \pi \arcsin^2(y) \triangle y\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Using similar reasoning for the upper interval and summing the slices using appropriate definite integrals, we find that%
\begin{equation*}
V = \int_0^{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} \pi  \arcsin^2(y) \, dy +  \int_{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}^1 \pi  \arccos^2(y) \, dy

\item\hypertarget{li-4349}{}\hypertarget{p-6753}{}%
Draw a picture. Revolving \(R\) about the line \(y = 2\), we see that cross-sections perpendicular to the line \(y = 2\) are washers with thickness \(\triangle x\), outer radius \(R(x) = 2 - \sin(x)\), and inner radius \(r(x) = 2 - \cos(x)\), since \(2 - \sin(x) \ge 2 - \cos(x)\) on the interval \([0, \frac{\pi}{4}]\). Thus, the volume of a typical slice is%
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{slice}} \approx \pi [(2 - \sin(x))^2 - (2 - \cos(x))^2] \triangle x
\end{equation*}
and hence integrating to sum the total volume, we find%
\begin{equation*}
V = \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}} \pi [(2 - \sin(x))^2 - (2 - \cos(x))^2] \, dx\text{.}

Revolving \(R\) about the line \(x = -1\), the resulting figure has solid cross-sections that are washers perpendicular to the \(y\)-axis with thickness \(\triangle x\); the inner radius is always \(r(y) = 1\), but the outer radius \(R(y)\) that governs the larger radius of each washer changes at the height where \(y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\) in the interval from \(y = 0\) to \(y = 1\). As in (d), we express the two curves that bound the region with \(x\) as a function of \(y\). On the interval from \(y = 0\) to \(y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\), \(R(y) = 1 + \arcsin(y)\); on the interval from \(y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\) to \(y = 1\),\(R(y) = 1 + \arccos(y)\). On the lower interval, a typical slice has volume%
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{slice}} \approx \pi [ (1+\arcsin(y))^2 - 1^2 ] \triangle y\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Using similar reasoning for the upper interval and summing the slices using appropriate definite integrals, we find that%
\begin{equation*}
V = \int_0^{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} \pi [ (1+\arcsin(y))^2 - 1^2 ] \, dy +  \int_{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}^1 \pi  [ (1+\arccos(y))^2 - 1^2 ] \, dy

\begin{equation*}
1+\frac{1}{2}(x-2)^2 = \frac{1}{2}x^2\text{,}

so \(2+(x-2)^2 = x^2\), which implies \(2+(x^2-4x+4) = x^2\) and thus \(4x=6\) so \(x = \frac{3}{2}\). Since \(g(x) = 1+\frac{1}{2}(x-2)^2 \ge \frac{1}{2}x^2 = f(x)\) on the interval \(\left[0, \frac{3}{2} \right]\), the area of the region between the two curves is%

(You should draw a picture of the solid, based on the figure above, with the region \(R\) revolved about \(y = -1\).)  We slice vertically so that our cross-sections are washers with thickness \(\triangle x\). Because we are revolving about \(y = -1\), the outer radius is \(R(x) = 2+\frac{1}{2}(x-2)^2\), while the inner radius is \(1+\frac{1}{2}x^2\). Hence the volume of a typical slice, which has thickness \(\triangle x\) is given by%
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{slice}} \approx \pi \left( R(x)^2 - r(x)^2 \right) \triangle x = \pi\left[\left(2+\frac{1}{2}(x-2)^2\right)^2 - \left(1+\frac{1}{2}x^2\right)^2 \right] \triangle x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Hence, the volume of the solid obtained by revolving the region \(R\) around the line \(y=-1\) is given by%
\begin{equation*}
V = \int_0^{1.5} \pi\left[\left(2+\frac{1}{2}(x-2)^2\right)^2 - \left(1+\frac{1}{2}x^2\right)^2 \right] \ dx = \frac{315}{32} \pi

(Draw a picture of the solid, based on revolving the region \(R\) about the \(y\)-axis.) We slice horizontally and thus the resulting cross-sections are cylinders with thickness \(\triangle y\). The radius of the disks changes as \(y\) passes through \(f\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{9}{8} = 1.125\), so we need two different integrals to find the total volume. Since we are slicing horizontally, we will integrate with respect to \(y\), so we  need to solve both of our equations for \(x\) as functions of \(y\). Observe that \(y = 1+\frac{1}{2}(x-2)^2 \) implies \(2(y-1) = (x-2)^2\), so \(x-2 = \pm \sqrt{2(y-1)}\) and thus \(x = 2 \pm \sqrt{2(y-1)}\), and similarly \(y = \frac{1}{2}x^2\) implies \(x = \pm \sqrt{2y}\). The portion of the curve defined by \(y = 1+\frac{1}{2}(x-2)^2\) that determines one of the boundaries is the left hand portion of the parabola, so \(x = 2 - \sqrt{2(y-1)}\), while the portion of the curve \(y = \frac{1}{2}x^2\) that determines the other boundary is the right hand portion of the parabola, so \(x = \sqrt{2y}\). These two curves define the radius of the disk (one for \(y \lt 1.125\), the other for \(y \gt 1.125\)) and the lowest point on the region is \((0,0)\) while the highest is \((0,3)\). So a sum of integrals that represents the volume of the solid obtained by revolving the region \(R\) around the \(y\)-axis is%
\begin{equation*}
V = \int_{0}^{1.125} \pi \left(\sqrt{2y}\right)^2 \ dy + \int_{1.125}^3 \pi \left(2 - \sqrt{2(y-1)}\right)^2 \ dy \approx 7.06858347

Recall that the length of a curve defined by a function \(f\) on an interval \([a,b]\) is given by%
\begin{equation*}
\int_a^b \sqrt{1+(f'(x))^2} \ dx\text{.}

To find the perimeter of the region \(R\) we calculate the length of the curves defined by \(y = 1+\frac{1}{2}(x-2)^2\) (for which \(y' = x-2\)) and \(y=\frac{1}{2}x^2\) (for which \(y' = x\)) on the interval \([0,1.5]\) and the length of the segment along \(x=0\) as \(y\) goes from \(0\) to \(3\). This last length is \(3\), so the perimeter of the region \(R\) is given by%
\begin{equation*}
P = 3 + \int_0^{1.5} \sqrt{1+(x-2)^2} + \sqrt{1+x^2} \ dx \approx 7.387234642\text{.}

Any point \(P = (x,y) \) on the Cartesian plane can be represented in polar coordinates using its distance from the origin point \((0,0) \) and the angle formed from the positive \(x\)-axis counterclockwise to the point. Sometimes this representation provides a more useful way of describing the point's location, or even all of the points along a curve, than conventional Cartesian coordinates.%

Representing curves in polar coordinates, we can continue to ask the same questions such as ``What is the area under the curve?'' and ``How long is the curve?''. In this section we learn how the definite integral may be used to find answers to these questions.%

Using the above relationships, the \(x\)- and \(y\)-coordinates of the point are%

x=r\cos(\theta)=2\cos(4.3) \hspace{.25in} \text{ and } \hspace{.25in} y=r\sin(\theta)=2\sin(4.3)\text{.}

Since \(\theta=4.3\) radians is not a common angle on the unit circle, we need to use our calculators to find approximate values for \(x\) and \(y\). Doing so, we get%
\begin{align*}
x \amp= 2\cos(4.3) \approx -0.8016,\\

Since this cosine value does not correspond to a common angle on the unit circle, we must use the inverse cosine function to solve for \(\theta\), which gives us%

\hypertarget{p-6811}{}%
Any equation written in Cartesian coordinates can be converted to one in polar coordinates and vice-versa. In practice, it makes sense to use the representation that is most natural for the application, or the one which is simpler to express. For example, the unit circle of radius 1 about the origin may be expressed in Cartesian coordinates using the equation%
\begin{equation*}
x^2 + y^2 = 1. 
\end{equation*}
Since the points on the circle are precisely those points at distance \(r \) from the origin, in polar coordinates the equation may be written as%
\begin{equation*}
r = 1. 
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6812}{}%
Algebraically, we can see that this is correct by substituting \(x = r \cos(\theta) \) and \(y = r \sin(\theta) \) into the original equation to obtain%
\begin{equation*}
x^2 + y^2 = 1 
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
r^2 \cos^2(\theta) + r^2 \sin^2(\theta) = 1 
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
r^2\big( \cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta) \big) = 1 \text{.}
\end{equation*}
Using the trig identity \(\cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta) =1 \), this becomes%
\begin{equation*}
r^2 = 1 \text{.}
\end{equation*}
Since \(r\) denotes the length of the radius to the point, it follows that \(r\gt0\); hence, \(r = 1. \)%
\par

We now look at some special families of graphs in polar coordinates.%

One interesting family of graphs in polar coordinates are the \terminology{rose graphs}. These are curves of the form%
\begin{equation*}

or%
\begin{equation*}
r = a \sin (n \theta),

\hypertarget{p-6827}{}%
How would we approximate the area of this region? Our normal strategy would be to cut the region into rectangles and take a Riemann sum of the areas of those rectangles, but because we are working in polar coordinates, it is more natural to approximate the region with the sectors of a circle. One such sector is drawn on the image. That sector has an angle of \(\Delta \theta\) and a radius of \(f(\theta_i)\), so%
\begin{equation*}
\text{area}_{\text{slice}} \approx \text{area}_{\text{sector}}= \frac 12 (f(\theta_i))^2 \Delta \theta \text{.}
\end{equation*}
Taking the Riemann sum and taking the limit as \(\Delta \theta \rightarrow 0 \), we get that the area of the region is given by the integral \(\int_\alpha^\beta \frac 12 (f(\theta))^2 \, d \theta \).%

\hypertarget{p-6828}{}%
For this particular function, the area contained by \(r=f(\theta)\) on the interval \(0\le\theta\le2\pi\) is thus%

Since \(r=2 \theta+3\), \(x=r \cos(\theta)\), and \(y=r \sin(\theta)\), and \(\theta=\frac{3\pi}4\) at A, then%

r=\frac{3 \pi}{2}+3,\\

y= \left(\frac{3 \pi}{2}+3 \right)\left(\frac{\sqrt 2}2\right) \approx 5.45\text{.}

Now to find \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) we write%
\begin{equation*}
x= r \cos(\theta)=(2 \theta+3) \cos(\theta)\\
y= r \sin(\theta)=(2 \theta+3) \sin(\theta).

Thus, taking \(\frac{d}{d\theta}[x]\) and \(\frac{d}{d\theta}[y]\) and applying the product rule, we get%

\frac{dy}{d\theta} = 2\sin(\theta)+ (2 \theta +3)(\cos(\theta))\text{.}

\subsection[{Density}]{Density}\label{subsection-175}
\index{density}\hypertarget{p-6920}{}%
The \emph{mass} \index{mass} of an object, typically measured in metric units such as grams or kilograms, is a measure of the amount of material in the object. The \emph{density} of an object measures the distribution of mass per unit volume. For instance, if a brick has mass 3 kg and volume 0.002 m\(^3\), then the density of the brick is%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{3 \mbox{kg} }{0.002 \mbox{m} ^3} = 1500 \frac{\mbox{kg} }{\mbox{m} ^3}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6921}{}%
As another example, the mass density of water is 1000 kg/m\(^3\). Each of these relationships demonstrate the following general principle.%
\begin{assemblage}[Density Formula]\label{assemblage-144}
\hypertarget{p-6922}{}%
For an object of constant density \(d\), with mass \(m\) and volume \(V\),%
\begin{equation*}
d = \frac{m}{V}, \ \text{or}  \ m = d \cdot V\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-6923}{}%
But what happens when the density is not constant?%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6924}{}%
The formula \(m = d \cdot V\) is reminiscent of two other equations that we have used in our work: for a body moving in a fixed direction, distance = rate \(\cdot\) time, and, for a rectangle, its area is given by \(A = l \cdot w\). These formulas hold when the principal quantities involved, such as the rate the body moves and the height of the rectangle, are \emph{constant}. When these quantities are not constant, we have turned to the definite integral for assistance. By working with small slices on which the quantity of interest (such as velocity) is approximately constant, we can use a definite integral to add up the values on the pieces.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6925}{}%
For example, if we have a nonnegative velocity function that is not constant, over a short time interval \(\Delta t\), we know that the distance traveled is approximately \(v(t) \Delta t\) since \(v(t)\) is almost constant on a small interval. Similarly, if we are thinking about the area under a nonnegative function \(f\) whose value is changing, on a short interval \(\Delta x\), the area under the curve is approximately the area of the rectangle whose height is \(f(x)\) and whose width is \(\Delta x\): \(f(x) \Delta x\). Both of these principles are represented visually in \hyperref[F-6-3-VelArea]{Figure~\ref{F-6-3-VelArea}}.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/6_3_VelArea.pdf}
\caption{At left, estimating a small amount of distance traveled, \(v(t) \Delta t\), and at right, a small amount of area under the curve, \(f(x) \Delta x\).\label{F-6-3-VelArea}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-6926}{}%
In a similar way, if the density of some object is not constant, we can use a definite integral to compute the overall mass of the object. We will focus on problems where the density varies in only one dimension, say along a single axis.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-287}
\hypertarget{p-6927}{}%
Let's consider a thin bar of length \(b\) whose left end is at the origin, where \(x = 0\), and assume that the bar has constant cross-sectional area of 1 cm\(^2\). We let \(\rho(x)\) represent the mass density function of the bar, measured in grams per cubic centimeter. That is, given a location \(x\), \(\rho(x)\) tells us approximately how much mass will be found in a one-centimeter wide slice of the bar at \(x\).%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/6_3_Bar.pdf}
\caption{A thin bar of constant cross-sectional area 1 cm\(^2\) with density function \(\rho(x)\) g/cm\(^3\).\label{F-6-3-Bar}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-6928}{}%
The volume of a thin slice of the bar of width \(\Delta x\), as pictured in \hyperref[F-6-3-Bar]{Figure~\ref{F-6-3-Bar}}, is the cross-sectional area times \(\Delta x\). Since the cross-sections each have constant area 1 cm\(^2\), it follows that the volume of the slice is \(1 \Delta x\) cm\(^3\). And because mass is the product of density and volume, we see that the mass of this slice is approximately%
\begin{equation*}
\text{mass} _{\text{slice} } \approx \rho(x) \ \frac{\mbox{g} }{\mbox{cm} ^3} \cdot 1 \Delta x \ \mbox{cm} ^3 = \rho(x) \cdot \Delta x \ \mbox{g}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6929}{}%
Therefore, the total mass of the bar is measured by the corresponding Riemann sum (and the integral that it approximates)%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{i=1}^n \rho(x_i) \Delta x \approx \int_0^b \rho(x) \, dx=\text{mass}_{\text{total}}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
(As usual, the Riemann sum is an approximation, while the integral will be the exact mass.)%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-6930}{}%
For objects whose cross-sectional area is constant and whose mass is distributed relative to horizontal location, \(x\), it makes sense to think of the density function \(\rho(x)\) with units ``mass per unit length,'' such as g/cm. Thus, when we compute \(\rho(x) \cdot \Delta x\) on a small slice \(\Delta x\), the resulting units are (g/cm) \(\cdot\) (cm) = g, which thus measures the mass of the slice. The general principle follows.%
\begin{assemblage}[Calculating Mass using a Definite Integral]\label{assemblage-145}
\hypertarget{p-6931}{}%
For an object of constant cross-sectional area whose mass is distributed along a single axis according to the function \(\rho(x)\) (whose units are units of mass per unit of length), the total mass, \(M\), of the object between \(x = a\) and \(x = b\) is given by%
\begin{equation*}
M = \int_a^b \rho(x) \, dx\text{.}

With the cone having its base centered at the origin and being a solid of revolution about the \(x\)-axis, the cone is generated by the line \(y = 4 - \frac{4}{5}x\). Using the disk method, it follows that the cone's volume is%

\item\hypertarget{li-4441}{}\hypertarget{p-6956}{}%

If the cone has non-uniform density, but is uniform across cross sections parallel to its base such that in each cross section a distance \(x\) units from the origin has its density given by \(\rho(x) = 400 + \frac{200}{1+x^2}\) kg/m\(^3\), we naturally consider slices of the cone that are perpendicular to the \(x\)-axis. For each such slice, the radius is \(r(x) = 4 - \frac{4}{5}x\), which makes the volume of the slice%
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{slice}} \approx \pi (4-\frac{4}{5}x)^2 \Delta x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Since the density is constant on the slice with value \(\rho(x) = 400 + \frac{200}{1+x^2}\), it follows that the mass of the slice is%
\begin{equation*}
M_{\text{slice}} \approx (400 + \frac{200}{1+x^2}) \cdot \pi (4-\frac{4}{5}x)^2 \Delta x\text{.}

The total mass of the bar is given by \(M = \int_{0}^{12} \frac{1}{25}(x-15)^2 \, dx = \frac{1116}{25}\). To find where to cut the bar in two so that the two pieces have equal mass, we have to determine the value of \(b\) such that%
\begin{equation*}
\int_{0}^{b} \frac{1}{25}(x-15)^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1116}{25}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Since \(\int_{0}^{b} \frac{1}{25}(x-15)^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{75}( (b-15)^3 - (-15)^3 )\), we need to have \(b\) satisfy the equation%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{75}( (b-15)^3 - (-15)^3 ) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1116}{25}\text{.}

\subsection[{Radial Density}]{Radial Density}\label{subsection-176}
\hypertarget{p-6959}{}%
In some 2D or 3D objects, density depends on distance from a center point. In this case, we will apply the principle from the previous section (that mass is the integral of density), but must make a slight adjustment to account for the fact that layers of the same thickness will have different volumes depending on their distance from the center.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-289}
\hypertarget{p-6960}{}%
Consider a 1 meter long metal pipe covered with a layer of insulation. \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/6_4_Ex4_Figure.pdf}
 How would we find the total mass of the pipe? We would need to add up the masses of the metal and the insulation, and these masses can be found by taking density times volume:%
\begin{equation*}
\text{mass}_{\text{layer}}=\rho_{\text{layer}}V_{\text{layer}}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6961}{}%
But note that the density of the layer depends on its distance from the center: close to the center of the pipe, the hollow core of the pipe has 0 density, at a radius of \(r_1\) the metal pipe has a high density, and at a radius of \(r_2\) the insulation has a low density. Let us use \(\rho(r)\) to denote the density as a function of distance \(r\) from the center.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6962}{}%
Next, to get \(V_{\text{layer}}\) we can use approximate volume as circumference times thickness times length, so \(V \approx (2\pi r_i)(\Delta r)(1 \text{ meter})=(2\pi r_i)(\Delta r)\). Thus the mass of a single layer is approximately%
\begin{equation*}
\text{mass}_i \approx \rho(r_i)(2\pi r_i)(\Delta r).
\end{equation*}
Summing both layers, we get that%
\begin{equation*}
\text{mass} \approx \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^2 \rho(r_i)(2\pi r_i)(\Delta r)
\end{equation*}
is the total mass of the pipe.%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-6963}{}%
We can generalize the formula we found in the previous example to any object for which density depends on radius. That more general formula is%
\begin{equation*}
\text{mass} \approx \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n \rho(r_i)(2\pi r_i)(\Delta r)
\end{equation*}
where \(\rho(r)\) is the density of the object a distance of \(r_i\) from the center.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6964}{}%
Similar to the earlier applications in this chapter: we will take the limit as \(\Delta r \rightarrow 0 \), and doing so turns the sum into an integral.%
\begin{assemblage}[Calculating Mass using a Definite Integral for Radially Symmetric Objects]\label{assemblage-146}
\hypertarget{p-6965}{}%
For a 2D disk (respectively, 3D cylinder), if the density of the object depends only on the distance from the center point (respectively, center axis) according to the function \(\rho(r)\), then the mass per unit length (respectively, mass of the object)  is given by the formula%
\begin{equation*}
\text{mass} = \displaystyle \int_{0}^R \rho(r)(2\pi r)\,  dr= \displaystyle \int_{0}^R 2 \pi r\rho(r)\,  dr
\end{equation*}
where \(R\) is the outer radius of the object.%
\end{assemblage}

\begin{equation*}
\rho_{axis}(x)= \int_0^{6-x}(2 \pi r) \rho_{radial}(r) \, dr \\

We must take the integral:%

so the mass of the earth is roughly \(5.7 \times 10^{12} \) trillions of kilograms.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4468}{}\hypertarget{p-7010}{}%
The volume formula for a sphere says that the volume of the earth is \(V=\frac{4}{3}\pi (6300)^3=1.05 \times 10^{12}\) cubic kilometers. Therefore, its average density is \(\displaystyle \frac{5.7 \times 10^{12}}{1.05 \times 10^{12}}=5.44\) trillions of kilograms per cubic kilometer.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4469}{}\hypertarget{p-7011}{}%
Goofus is incorrect. His calculation is wrong because he is not taking into account the factor of \(r^2\) inside the integral, which counts the lower-density parts on the outside of the earth more than the higher-density parts near the center. For instance, his average treated innermost 1 kilometer of the earth as having the same volume as the outermost 1 kilometer of earth, even though the latter is much larger in terms of volume.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4470}{}\hypertarget{p-7012}{}%
We will essentially repeat our calculations from parts (a.) and (b.), except with 1200 as the maximum radius instead of 6300. Therefore, the volume of the inner core is \(V=\frac{4}{3}\pi (1200)^3=7.24 \times 10^{9}\) cubic killometers, and the mass is%
\begin{equation*}
\text{mass}= \int_0^R 4 \pi r^2 \rho(r)\, dr = \int_0^{1200} 4 \pi r^2(-0.0016r+13)\, dr \\
= \left. 4\pi(-0.0004 r^4+\frac{13}{3}r^3) \right |_0^{1200}\\
\approx 8.37 \times 10^{10}
\end{equation*}
so the density is \((8.37 \times 10^{10})/(7.24 \times 10^{9})=11.56 \) trillion kilograms per cubic kilometer.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4471}{}\hypertarget{p-7013}{}%
In the previous parts, we saw that the mass of the inner core was \(8.37 \times 10^{10}\) and the mass of the whole earth was \(5.7 \times 10^{12}\), so dividing gives that approximately \(1.47 \%\) of the earth's mass is in the inner core.%

\hypertarget{p-7015}{}%
The concept of an average is a natural one, and one that we have used repeatedly as part of our understanding of the meaning of the definite integral. If we have \(n\) values \(a_1\), \(a_2\), \(\ldots\), \(a_n\), we know that their average is given by%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n}{n}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and for a quantity being measured by a function \(f\) on an interval \([a,b]\), the average value of the quantity on \([a,b]\) is%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b f(x) \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7016}{}%
As we continue to think about problems involving the distribution of mass, it is natural to consider the idea of a \emph{weighted} average, \index{weighted average} where certain quantities involved are counted more in the average.%

\overline{x} = \frac{2x_1 + 3x_2 + 1x_3 + 1x_4}{7} = \frac{2 \cdot 0 + 3 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 4 + 1 \cdot 6}{7} = \frac{16}{7}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Note particularly that we divide by the \emph{total weight} of the books, not the total number.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4500}{}\hypertarget{p-7054}{}%
Here we find%
\begin{equation*}
\overline{x} = \frac{2x_1 + 3x_2 + 1x_3 + 1x_4}{7} = \frac{2 \cdot 0 + 3 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 5 + 1 \cdot 6}{7} = \frac{17}{7}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
which moves the balancing point slightly to the right.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4501}{}\hypertarget{p-7055}{}%
In this situation, we find the balancing point moves significantly to the right:%
\begin{equation*}
\overline{x} = \frac{2x_1 + 3x_2 + 1x_3 + 2x_4}{7} = \frac{2 \cdot 0 + 3 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot 6}{7} = \frac{22}{7}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-4502}{}\hypertarget{p-7056}{}%
Try, for instance, having \(x_2 = 1\) and \(x_3 = 2\) and experiment with different weights.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4503}{}\hypertarget{p-7057}{}%
If we have an existing arrangement and balancing point, moving one of the locations to the left will move the balancing point to the left; similarly, moving one of the locations to the right will move the balancing point to the right. If instead we add weight to an existing location, if that location is left of the balancing point, the balancing point will move left; the behavior is similar if on the right.%

In \hyperref[act-6-3-2]{Example~\ref{act-6-3-2}}, we saw that the balancing point of a system of point-masses\footnote{In the example, we actually used \emph{weight} rather than \emph{mass}. Since weight is proportional to mass, the computations for the balancing point result in the same location regardless of whether we use weight or mass. The gravitational constant is present in both the numerator and denominator of the weighted average.\label{fn-68}}(such as books on a shelf) is found by taking a weighted average of their respective locations. In the example, we were computing the \emph{center of mass} of a system of masses distributed along an axis, which is the balancing point of the axis on which the masses rest.%
\begin{assemblage}[Center of Mass (point-masses)]\label{assemblage-147}
\hypertarget{p-7059}{}%
For a collection of \(n\) masses \(m_1\), \(\ldots\), \(m_n\) that are distributed along a single axis at the locations \(x_1\), \(\ldots\), \(x_n\), the center of mass \index{center of mass (point-masses} is given by%
\begin{equation*}
\overline{x} = \frac{x_1 m_1  + x_2 m_2 + \cdots + x_n m_n}{m_1 + m_2 + \cdots + m_n}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-7060}{}%
Now consider a thin bar over which density is distributed continuously. If the density is constant, it is obvious that the balancing point of the bar is its midpoint. But if density is not constant, we must compute a weighted average. Let's say that the function \(\rho(x)\) tells us the density distribution along the bar, measured in g/cm. If we slice the bar into small sections, we can think of the bar as holding a collection of adjacent point-masses. The mass \(m_i\) of a slice of thickness \(\Delta x\) at location \(x_i\), is \(m_i \approx \rho(x_i) \Delta x\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7061}{}%
If we slice the bar into \(n\) pieces, we can approximate its center of mass by%
\begin{equation*}
\overline{x} \approx \frac{x_1 \cdot \rho(x_1) \Delta x + x_2 \cdot \rho(x_2) \Delta x  + \cdots + x_n \cdot \rho(x_n) \Delta x }{\rho(x_1) \Delta x + \rho(x_2) \Delta x + \cdots + \rho(x_n) \Delta x}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Rewriting the sums in sigma notation, we have%
\begin{equation}
\overline{x} \approx \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i \cdot \rho(x_i) \Delta x}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n} \rho(x_i) \Delta x}\text{.}\label{E-CtrOfM}
\end{equation}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7062}{}%
The greater the number of slices, the more accurate our estimate of the balancing point will be. The sums in \hyperref[E-CtrOfM]{Equation~(\ref{E-CtrOfM})} can be viewed as Riemann sums, so in the limit as \(n \to \infty\), we find that the center of mass is given by the quotient of two integrals.%
\begin{assemblage}[Center of Mass (continuous mass distribution)]\label{assemblage-148}
\hypertarget{p-7063}{}%
For a thin rod of density \(\rho(x)\) distributed along an axis from \(x = a\) to \(x = b\), the center of mass \index{center of mass (continuous mass distribution)} of the rod is given by%

Recall that average density is given by mass divided by length, so since the bar is 20 cm long and its mass is 100 g, the average density is 100/20 = 5 g/cm. This can also be computed using the formula for average value of a function:%
\begin{equation*}
\rho_{\text{AVG} [0,20]} = \frac{1}{20-0} \int_{0}^{20} \rho(x) \,dx = \frac{100}{20}\text{.}

Since \(p(x) = 4e^{0.020732x}\) lies below \(\rho(x) = 4 + 0.1x\) up until where they intersect at about \(17.53\), after which \(p(x) \gt \rho(x)\), we see that \(p(x)\) distributes mass more to the right. It also appears as if the two curves may bound the same total area, and thus the generate the same total mass. If that is the case, we expect \(\overline{x}\) for \(p(x)\) to lie slightly to the right of the center of mass for \(\rho(x)\).%

To find mass we slice the rod horizontally into uniform slices of length \(\Delta x\) and approximate the density on the \(i\)th slice with the constant density \(\rho(x_i)\). Then the approximate mass of the \(i\)th slice is \(\rho(x_i) \Delta x\). Adding the approximations and taking the limit as the number of slices goes to infinity gives us the definite integral%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^a \rho(x) \ dx
\end{equation*}
to represent the mass of the rod. Using the substitution \(u = -0.1x\) and \(du = -0.1 \ dx\) we have%
\begin{align*}
\int_0^a \rho(x) \ dx &= \int_0^a 10e^{-0.1x} \ dx\\
&= \int_0^{-0.1a} -100 e^u \ du\\
&= -100e^u \biggm|_0^{-0.1a}\\
&= -100\left(e^{-0.1a} - 1\right)\\
&= 100\left(1-e^{-0.1a}\right)\text{.}
\end{align*}
So if the mass is \(30\) g, then \(100\left(1-e^{-0.1a}\right) = 30\), so \(1-e^{-0.1a} = 0.3\), and \(e^{-0.1a} = 0.7\). It follows that \(-0.1a = \ln(0.7)\), and thus, \(a = -10 \ln(0.7) \approx 3.567 \text{ cm}\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-4541}{}\hypertarget{p-7110}{}%
Since the density is a decreasing function, we should expect that the center of mass of the rod will lie to the left of the midpoint.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4542}{}\hypertarget{p-7111}{}%
To find the center of mass, we slice the rod horizontally into uniform slices of length \(\Delta x\) and approximate the mass on the \(i\)th slice with the constant density \(\rho(x_i)\) to be \(\rho(x_i) \Delta x\) as in (a). The position of the \(i\)th slice is approximately \(x_i/\). Treating the rod as a collection of \(n\) discrete masses (the slices), the center of mass \(\overline{x}\) is approximately%
\begin{equation*}
\overline{x} \approx \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \rho(x_i) \Delta x}{\sum_{i=1}^n \rho(x_i) \Delta x}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Letting the number of slices go to infinity gives us the exact location of the center of mass of the rod,%
\begin{equation*}
\overline{x} = \frac{\int_0^a x \rho(x) \ dx}{\int_0^a \rho(x) \ dx}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
The mass of the rod is \(30\) g, so now we just need to evaluate \(\int_0^a x \rho(x) \ dx = \int_0^a 10xe^{-0.1x} \ dx\). Integrating by parts with \(u = x\), \(du = dx\), \(dv = e^{-0.1x} \ dx\), and \(v = -10e^{-0.1x}\) gives us%
\begin{align*}
\int_0^a 10xe^{-0.1x} \ dx  &= 10\left(-10xe^{-0.1x}\biggm|_0^a + \int_0^a -10e^{-0.1x} \ dx \right)\\
&= 10\left(-10ae^{-0.1a} + 100(1-e^{-0.1a})\right)\\
&\approx 10\left(-10(3.567)ae^{-0.1(3.567)} + 100(1-e^{-0.1(3.567)})\right)\\
&\approx 50.3338\text{.}
\end{align*}
So the center of mass is \(\overline{x} \approx \frac{50.3338}{30} \approx 1.687\), which is less than midway across the \(3.567\) cm rod as expected.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4543}{}\hypertarget{p-7112}{}%
Each piece would have mass \(15\) grams. Let \(q\) be a value of \(x\) between 0 and \(a\) so the the mass of the rod on the interval \([0, q]\) is 15. Using the substitution \(u = -0.1x\) and \(du = -0.1 \ dx\) we have that the mass of the rod on the interval \([0, q]\) is%
\begin{align*}
\int_0^q \rho(x) \ dx  &= \int_0^q 10e^{-0.1x} \ dx\\
&= \int_0^{-0.1q} -100e^{u} \ du\\
&= -100e^u\biggm|_0^{-0.1q}\\
&= 100\left(1-e^{-0.1q}\right)
\end{align*}
We want this mass to be \(15\) grams, so we find \(q\) such that \(100\left(1-e^{-0.1q}\right) = 15\). Solving for \(q\) in the usual way, we find \(q = -10\ln(0.85) \approx 1.625\) cm. Note that this is not the same as the center of mass. The center of mass takes into account the torque (determined by distance from the center of mass), which is not incorporated into the calculation of the point to split the object into two pieces of equal mass.%

To find the mass of the first bar, we use the fact that \(M = \int_0^a \rho(x) \, dx\), with \(a = 10\) and \(\rho(x) = \frac{1}{1+x^2}\). Thus, the mass of the first bar is%
\begin{equation*}
M_1 = \int_0^{10} \frac{1}{1+x^2} \, dx = \left. \arctan(x) \right|_0^{10}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
so \(M_1 = \arctan(10) \approx 1.47113\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7131}{}%
Similar computations for the second bar shows that its mass is%
\begin{equation*}
M_2 = \int_0^{10} e^{-0.1x} \, dx = \left. -10e^{-0.1x} \right|_0^{10}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
so \(M_2 = 10 - 10e^{-1} \approx 6.32121\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-4557}{}\hypertarget{p-7132}{}%
To find the center of mass of each bar, we use the standard formula:%
\begin{equation*}
\overline{x} = \frac{\int_0^{10} x \rho(x) \, dx}{\int_0^{10} \rho(x) \, dx}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Having already evaluated the denominator for each mass distribution, we simply need to compute the numerator. It is straightforward to show that%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^{10} x \frac{1}{1+x^2} \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \ln(101) \approx 2.30756\text{,}
\end{equation*}
so the first bar's center of mass is%
\begin{equation*}
\overline{x_1} = \frac{\arctan(10)}{\frac{1}{2}\ln(101)} \approx \frac{2.30756}{1.47113} \approx 1.56857\text{.}
\end{equation*}
For the second bar,%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^{10} x e^{-0.1x} \, dx = 100-200e^{-1} \approx 26.42411\text{,}
\end{equation*}
so its center of mass is%
\begin{equation*}
\overline{x_2} = \frac{10 - 10e^{-1}}{100-200e^{-1}} \approx \frac{26.42411}{6.32121} \approx 4.18023\text{.}

%
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
\item\hypertarget{li-4559}{}\hypertarget{p-7135}{}%
The mass of this new bar is \(M = \int_0^{10} (\rho(x) + p(x)) \, dx\). Using the additive property of the definite integral,%
\begin{equation*}
M = \int_0^{10} \rho(x) \, dx + \int_0^{10} p(x) \, dx \approx 1.47113 + 6.32121 = 7.79234\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-4560}{}\hypertarget{p-7136}{}%
Applying the same idea to \(\int_0^{10} xf(x) \, dx\), we have%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^{10} x(\rho(x) + p(x))) \, dx = \int_0^{10} x \rho(x) \, dx + \int_0^{10} x p(x) \, dx 
\approx 2.30756 + 26.42411 = 28.73167\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-4561}{}\hypertarget{p-7137}{}%
False. The center of mass of the new bar is%
\begin{equation*}
\overline{x} = \frac{\int_0^{10} x(\rho(x) + p(x)) \, dx}{\int_0^{10} (\rho(x) + p(x)) \, dx} \approx \frac{2.30756 + 26.42411}{1.47113 + 6.32121} = 3.68717
\end{equation*}
while the average of the two bars' centers of mass is%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\overline{x_1} + \overline{x_2}}{2} \approx \frac{\frac{2.30756}{1.47113} + \frac{26.42411}{6.32121}}{2} = 2.8744\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Although the computations prove the conclusion, the result is also intuitive: the average treats the two bars as equal contributors and doesn't take into account that one bar has much more mass than the other. Indeed, a weighted average is needed to correctly compute the center of mass, which is what our earlier computations in (i) and (ii) accomplish.%

\hypertarget{p-7150}{}%
The plot shown above (with the curve reflected across the \(x\)-axis to generate the solid of revolution) shows why this solid of revolution is a reasonable approximation to a baseball bat (if perhaps a bit thin between \(x = 3\) and \(x = 9\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-4573}{}\hypertarget{p-7151}{}%
We use the disk method to find the volume of the solid of revolution. In the usual way, the volume of a typical slice is%
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{slice}} \approx \pi (2xe^{-1.25x} + (30-x) e^{-0.25(30-x)})^2 \triangle x
\end{equation*}
and thus using a definite integral to sum the volumes of the slices, we get%
\begin{equation*}
V = \int_0^{30} \pi (2xe^{-1.25x} + (30-x) e^{-0.25(30-x)})^2 \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Using technology to evaluate the integral, we find that \(V \approx 52.0666\) cubic inches.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4574}{}\hypertarget{p-7152}{}%
Given that the bat has (constant) weight density \(0.6\) ounces per cubic inch, it follows that the total weight of the bat is \(W \approx 0.6 \cdot 52.0666 = 31.23996\) ounces.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4575}{}\hypertarget{p-7153}{}%
If we slice the baseball bat perpendicular to the horizontal axes, we get thin cylindrical disks as cross-sections. At a given \(x\)-location, the amount of weight concentrated there is approximately the weight density (\(0.6\) ounces per cubic inch) times the volume of the slice, which is \(V_{text{slice}} \approx \pi f(x)^2\). Thus, we see that the amount of weight concentrated at a location \(x\) along the bat is given by \(\rho(x) = 0.6 \pi f(x)^2\), which we can therefore view as being the weight density function for how the weight of the baseball bat is distributed from \(x = 0\) to \(x = 30\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-4576}{}\hypertarget{p-7154}{}%
Even though we are dealing with ``weight'' instead of ``mass'', we can compute the center of mass in the usual way since weight differs from mass only by the gravitational constant, and this constant is present in both the numerator and denominator of the center of mass. Thus, using the standard formula,%
\begin{equation*}
\overline{x} = \frac{\int_0^{30} x \rho(x) \ dx}{\int_0^{30} \rho(x) \ dx}
\end{equation*}
so%
\begin{align*}
\overline{x} &= \frac{\int_0^{30} x \cdot 0.6 \pi (2xe^{-1.25x} + (30-x) e^{-0.25(30-x)})^2) \ dx}{\int_0^{30} 0.6 \pi (2xe^{-1.25x} + (30-x) e^{-0.25(30-x)})^2 \ dx}\\
&= \frac{\int_0^{30} x \cdot (2xe^{-1.25x} + (30-x) e^{-0.25(30-x)})^2) \ dx}{\int_0^{30} (2xe^{-1.25x} + (30-x) e^{-0.25(30-x)})^2 \ dx}\\
&\approx \frac{384.735}{16.5733} = 23.21415\text{,}
\end{align*}
so the center of mass is just over 2/3 along the length of the bat.%

How do we measure the work accomplished by a varying force that moves an object a certain distance?%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-7159}{}%
What is the total force exerted by water against a dam?%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-7160}{}%
How are both of the above concepts and their corresponding use of definite integrals similar to problems we have encountered in the past involving formulas such as ``distance equals rate times time'' and ``mass equals density times volume''?%
\end{itemize}
\end{objectives}
\leavevmode%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/6_4_Intro.pdf}
\caption{Three settings where we compute the accumulation of a varying quantity:  the area under \(y = f(x)\), the distance traveled by an object with velocity \(y = v(t)\), and the mass of a bar with density function \(y=\rho(x)\).\label{F-6-4-Intro}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-7161}{}%
We have seen several different circumstances where the definite integral enables us to measure the accumulation of a quantity that varies, provided the quantity is approximately constant over small intervals. For instance, to find the area bounded by a nonnegative curve \(y = f(x)\) and the \(x\)-axis on an interval \([a,b]\), we take a representative slice of width \(\Delta x\) that has area \(A_{\text{slice} } = f(x) \Delta x\). As we let the width of the representative slice tend to zero, we find that the exact area of the region is%
\begin{equation*}
A = \int_a^b f(x) \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7162}{}%
In a similar way, if we know the velocity \(v(t)\) of a moving object and we wish to know the distance the object travels on an interval \([a,b]\) where \(v(t)\) is nonnegative, we can use a definite integral to generalize the fact that \(d = r \cdot t\) when the rate, \(r\), is constant. On a short time interval \(\Delta t\), \(v(t)\) is roughly constant, so for a small slice of time, \(d_{\text{slice} } = v(t) \Delta t\). As the width of the time interval \(\Delta t\) tends to zero, the exact distance traveled is given by the definite integral%
\begin{equation*}
d = \int_a^b v(t) \, dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7163}{}%
Finally, if we want to determine the mass of an object of non-constant density, because \(M = D \cdot V\) (mass equals density times volume, provided that density is constant), we can consider a small slice of an object on which the density is approximately constant, and a definite integral may be used to determine the exact mass of the object. For instance, if we have a thin rod whose cross sections have constant density, but whose density is distributed along the \(x\) axis according to the function \(y = \rho(x)\), it follows that for a small slice of the rod that is \(\Delta x\) thick, \(M_{\text{slice} } = \rho(x) \Delta x\). In the limit as \(\Delta x \to 0\), we then find that the total mass is given by%
\begin{equation*}
M = \int_a^b \rho(x) \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7164}{}%
All three of these situations are similar in that we have a basic rule (\(A = l \cdot w\), \(d = r \cdot t\), \(M = D \cdot V\)) where one of the two quantities being multiplied is no longer constant; in each, we consider a small interval for the other variable in the formula, calculate the approximate value of the desired quantity (area, distance, or mass) over the small interval, and then use a definite integral to sum the results as the length of the small intervals is allowed to approach zero. It should be apparent that this approach will work effectively for other situations where we have a quantity that varies.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7165}{}%
We next turn to the notion of \emph{work}: \index{work} from physics, a basic principle is that work is the product of force and distance. For example, if a person exerts a force of 20 pounds to lift a 20-pound weight 4 feet off the ground, the total work accomplished is%
\begin{equation*}
W = F \cdot d = 20 \cdot 4 = 80 \ \text{foot-pounds}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7166}{}%
If force and distance are measured in English units (pounds and feet), then the units of work are \emph{foot-pounds}. \index{foot-pound} If we work in metric units, where forces are measured in Newtons (where \(1 N = 1 \ kg \cdot m/s^2\)) and distances in meters, the units of work are \emph{Newton-meters}. Note that Newton-meters are also called Joules. \index{Newton-meter}%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7167}{}%
Note that gravity pulls on an object of mass \(m\) with a force of \(mg \), where \(g \) is the gravitational constant \(g = 9.8 m/s^2 \). Since pounds are a unit of force, the value \(g \) is already incorporated into the pound. However, grams and kilograms are units of mass, so the force to move them needs to incorporate \(g \).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7168}{}%
For example, if a  20-kg weight is lifted 4 meters off the ground, the total work accomplished is%
\begin{equation*}
W = F \cdot d = (20 \text{ kg})\cdot (9.8 \ m/s^2) \cdot 4 \text{ m} = 784 \ kg \cdot m^2/s^2 = 784 \text{ Newton-meters}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7169}{}%
Of course, the formula \(W = F \cdot d\) only applies when the force is constant over the distance \(d\). In \hyperref[PA-6-4]{Example~\ref{PA-6-4}}, we explore one way that we can use a definite integral to compute the total work accomplished when the force exerted varies.%
\begin{example}[]\label{PA-6-4}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-4588}{}\hypertarget{p-7178}{}%
Since \(B(h)\) is changing at a constant rate, it is linear, so we must find a linear function with \(B(0)=20\) and \(B(50)=12\). Therefore, \(B(h)\) has an intercept of \(b=20\), and a slope of \(m=\frac{12-20}{50-0}=-\frac 4{25}\) so \(B(h)=-\frac{4}{25}h+20\) feet.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4589}{}\hypertarget{p-7179}{}%
If \(\Delta h = 2\), then \(B(5) \Delta h=38.4\) foot-pounds. At \(h = 5\), the bucket weighed \(B(5)\) pounds, so if the bucket's weight stopped changing then, it would have taken \(B(5) \Delta h=38.4\) foot-pounds of work to raise it \(\Delta h = 2\) feet. Since the bucket's weight actually did not stay constant, this number is slightly off, but since the bucket's weight did not change by too much over the time period, it will not be off by much.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4590}{}\hypertarget{p-7180}{}%
The answer above is an over-estimate of the work it would have taken. The answer above would correspond to the bucket's weight remaining constant after \(h = 5\), but since the bucket continued to get lighter after that point, it would have taken less work than our calculation showed.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4591}{}\hypertarget{p-7181}{}%
If \(\Delta h = .25\), then \(B(22) \Delta h=4.12\) foot-pounds. This represents the approximate amount of work it would have taken to raise the bucket \(.25\) feet further once the bucket had been raised 22 feet.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4592}{}\hypertarget{p-7182}{}%
More generally, the quantity \(W_{\text{slice} } = B(h) \Delta h\) measures the amount of work it would take to raise the bucket an additional \(\Delta h\) feet once you've raised it \(h\) feet already.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4593}{}\hypertarget{p-7183}{}%
By the power rule,%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^{50} B(h) \, dh =\int_0^{50} -\frac 4 {25} h +20 \, dh \\
= -\frac{2}{25} h^2 +20 h \Large |_0^{50}\\
= (-\frac{2}{25} (50)^2 +20(50))-(0)=800  \text{.}
\end{equation*}
This represents the amount of work, in foot-pounds, that it would take to raise the bucket from \(h=0\) (the bottom of the well) to \(h=50\) (the top of the well). This calculation provides the right answer because, in order to find the amount of work, we'd want to take very thin slices of the form \(W_{\text{slice} } = B(h) \Delta h\), sum them, and then take the limit as the slices get thinner (meaning as \(\Delta h \rightarrow 0 \)). Of course, this would be a Reimann sum, and in the limit as \(\Delta h \rightarrow 0 \) it would turn into an integral.%

Because work is calculated by the rule%

whenever the force \(F\) is constant, it follows that we can use a definite integral to compute the work accomplished by a varying force.%

In contrast to the problem in \hyperref[PA-6-4]{Example~\ref{PA-6-4}}, this bucket is not leaking at a constant rate; but because the weight of the bucket and water is not constant, we have to use a definite integral to determine the total work done in lifting the bucket.%

At a height \(h\) above the water, the approximate work to move the bucket a small distance \(\Delta h\) is%

Hence, if we let \(\Delta h\) tend to 0 and take the sum of all of the slices of work accomplished on these small intervals, it follows that the total work is given by%

When the full rope is extended over the cliff, the weight of the hanging rope is 200 pounds. Every foot of rope weighs 0.3 pounds; in addition, the quantity \((200-h)\) measures the number of feet of rope hanging over the cliff when \(h\) feet of rope have been pulled in. This means that the function \(F(h)\) whose value is the weight of the rope hanging over the cliff after \(h\) feet have been pulled in is given by \(F(h) = 0.3(200-h)\). When a small amount of rope, \(\Delta h\), is pulled in, the work to move that slice of rope is given by%
\begin{equation*}
W_{\text{slice}} = F(h) \Delta h = 0.3(200-h) \Delta h\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Thus, the total work to pull in the 200 feet of rope is given by%

W = \int_0^{200} 0.3(200-h) \, dh = 6000 \text{ foot-pounds}\text{.}

Since \(B(h)\) changes at a constant rate, \(B\) is a linear function. We know that \(B(0) = 40\) and that \(B\) loses weight at a rate of 0.1 pounds per foot of rope hauled in. Thus, \(B(h) = 40 - 0.1h\). It follows that the total work to life the leaky bucket 100 feet is%

W = int_0^{100} (40-0.1h) \, dh = 3500 \text{ foot-pounds}\text{.}

W = \int_0^{100} (25 + 5e^{-0.05h})\, dh \approx 2597.98 \text{ foot-pounds}\text{.}

Suppose that a sump crock has the shape of a frustum of a cone, as pictured in \hyperref[F-6-4-Crock]{Figure~\ref{F-6-4-Crock}}. The crock has a diameter of 3 feet at its surface, a diameter of 1.5 feet at its base, and a depth of 4 feet. In addition, suppose that the sump pump is set up so that it pumps the water vertically up a pipe to a drain that is located at ground level just outside a basement window. To accomplish this, the pump must send the water to a location 9 feet above the surface of the sump crock. How much work is required to empty the sump crock if it is initially completely full?%

\end{figure}
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-389}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-7225}{}%
It is helpful to think of the depth below the surface of the crock as being the independent variable, so we let the positive \(x\)-axis point down, and the positive \(y\)-axis to the right, as pictured in the figure. Because the pump sits on the surface of the water, it makes sense to think about the pump moving the water one ``slice'' at a time, where it takes a thin slice from the surface, pumps it out of the tank, and then proceeds to pump the next slice below.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7226}{}%
Each slice of water is cylindrical in shape. We see that the radius of each slice varies according to the linear function \(y = f(x)\) that passes through the points \((0,1.5)\) and \((4,0.75)\), where \(x\) is the depth of the particular slice in the tank; it is a straightforward exercise to find that \(f(x) = 1.5 - 0.1875x\). Now we think about the problem in several steps: \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
\item\hypertarget{li-4617}{}determining the volume of a typical slice;%
\item\hypertarget{li-4618}{}finding the weight\footnote{We assume that the weight density of water is 62.4 pounds per cubic foot.\label{fn-70}} of a typical slice (and thus the force that must be exerted on it);%
\item\hypertarget{li-4619}{}deciding the distance that a typical slice moves;%
\item\hypertarget{li-4620}{}and computing the work to move a representative slice.%
\end{enumerate}
 Once we know the work it takes to move one slice, we use a definite integral over an appropriate interval to find the total work.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7227}{}%
Consider a representative cylindrical slice at a depth of \(x\) feet below the top of the crock. The approximate volume of that slice is given by%
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{slice} } = \pi f(x)^2 \Delta x = \pi (1.5 - 0.1875x)^2 \Delta x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7228}{}%
Since water weighs 62.4 lb/ft\(^3\), the approximate weight of a representative slice is%
\begin{equation*}
F_{\text{slice} } = 62.4 \cdot V_{\text{slice} } = 62.4 \pi (1.5 - 0.1875x)^2 \Delta x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
This is also the approximate force the pump must exert to move the slice.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7229}{}%
Because the slice is located at a depth of \(x\) feet below the top of the crock, the slice being moved by the pump must move \(x\) feet to get to the level of the basement floor, and then, as stated in the problem description, another 9 feet to reach the drain at ground level. Hence, the total distance a representative slice travels is%
\begin{equation*}
d_{\text{slice} } = x + 9\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7230}{}%
Finally, the work to move a representative slice is given by%
\begin{equation*}
W_{\text{slice} } = F_{\text{slice} } \cdot d_{\text{slice} } = 62.4 \pi (1.5 - 0.1875x)^2 \Delta x \cdot (x+9)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7231}{}%
We sum the work required to move slices throughout the tank (from \(x = 0\) to \(x = 4\)), let \(\Delta x \to 0\), and hence%
\begin{equation*}
W = \int_0^4 62.4 \pi (1.5 - 0.1875x)^2 (x+9) \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
When evaluated using appropriate technology, the integral shows that the total work is \(W = 3463.2 \pi\) foot-pounds.%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-7232}{}%
The preceding example demonstrates the standard approach to finding the work required to empty a tank filled with liquid. The main task in each such problem is to determine the volume of a representative slice, followed by the force exerted on the slice, as well as the distance such a slice moves. In the case where the units are metric, there is one key difference: in the metric setting, rather than weight, we normally first find the mass of a slice. For instance, if distance is measured in meters, the mass density of water is 1000 kg/m\(^3\). In that setting, we can find the mass of a typical slice (in kg). To determine the force required to move it, we use \(F = ma\), where \(m\) is the object's mass and \(a\) is the gravitational constant \(9.81\) N/kg. That is, in metric units, the weight density of water is 9810 N/m\(^3\).%

A typical slice is a thin cylinder of radius 2 and thickness \(\Delta x\). The volume of such a cylinder is \(V_{\text{slice}} = \pi (2)^2 \Delta x\), and its weight is thus \(F_{\text{slice}} = 1000 \cdot 9.8 \cdot V_{\text{slice}} = 4000 \pi \Delta x\). Finally, the distance such a slice travels to the top of the tank is \(d_{\text{slice}} = x\). If we only pump out the top 1 m of water, it follows that the total work is%
\begin{equation*}
W = \int_{0}^{1} 9.8 \cdot 4000\pi \cdot x \, dx = 19600 \pi \, \text{newton-meters}\text{.}

Viewing the tank as a solid of revolution, the tank is generated by the function \(R(x) = \sqrt{100-x^2}\), and a typical slice has volume \(V_{\text{slice}} = \pi (\sqrt{100-x^2})^2 \Delta x\). The force to move such a slice is its weight, \(F_{\text{slice}} = 62.4 \cdot V_{\text{slice}} = 62.4 \pi (100-x^2) \Delta x\). Each slice has to move \(x\) feet to clear the top of the tank, and then an additional 5 feet up to the truck, so the distance each slice moves is \(d_{\text{slice}} = x + 5\). Finally, since the tank is full to a depth of 7 feet, and we wish to pump out the top 5 feet, \(x\) ranges from \(x=3\) (the top of the water) to \(x=8\) (the point at which there are 2 feet remaining in the tank). Hence, the total work done is%
\begin{equation*}

The line that bounds the right edge of the triangular face of the tank lying in the first quadrant is \(y=\frac{5}{2} - \frac{5}{8}x\).

Thus, the volume of a typical slice is%

The distance a typical slice moves when pumped to the top of the tank is \(d_{\text{slice}} = x\), and since the tank is full to a depth of 3 feet (within 1 foot of the top) and we are going to empty the tank until 1 foot of water remains in it, we see that we need to integrate from \(x=1\) to \(x=3\), so%
\begin{equation*}

\subsection[{Force due to Hydrostatic Pressure}]{Force due to Hydrostatic Pressure}\label{subsection-182}
\hypertarget{p-7250}{}%
When building a dam, engineers need to know how much force water will exert against the face of the dam. This force comes from water pressure. The pressure a force exerts on a region is measured in units of force per unit of area: for example, the air pressure in a tire is often measured in pounds per square inch (PSI). Hence, we see that the general relationship is given by%
\begin{equation*}
P = \frac{F}{A}, \ \text{or}  \ F = P \cdot A\text{,}
\end{equation*}
where \(P\) represents pressure, \(F\) represents force, and \(A\) the area of the region being considered. Of course, in the equation \(F = PA\), we assume that the pressure is constant over the entire region \(A\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7251}{}%
We know from experience that the deeper one dives underwater while swimming, the greater the pressure exerted by the water. This is because at a greater depth, there is more water right on top of the swimmer: it is the force that ``column'' of water exerts that determines the pressure the swimmer experiences. The total water pressure is found by computing the total weight of the column of water that lies above a region of area 1 square foot at a fixed depth. At a depth of \(d\) feet, a rectangular column has volume \(V = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot d\) ft\(^3\), so the corresponding weight of the water overhead is \(62.4d\). This is the amount of force being exerted on a 1 square foot region at a depth \(d\) feet underwater, so the pressure exerted by water at depth \(d\) is \(P = 62.4 d\) (lbs/ft\(^2\)).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7252}{}%
Because pressure is force per unit area, or \(P = \frac{F}{A}\), we can compute the total force from a variable pressure by integrating \(F = PA\).%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-301}
\hypertarget{p-7253}{}%
Consider a trapezoid-shaped dam that is 60 feet wide at its base and 90 feet wide at its top, and assume the dam is 25 feet tall with water that rises to within 5 feet of the top of its face. Water weighs 62.4 pounds per cubic foot. How much force does the water exert against the dam?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-391}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-7254}{}%
First, we sketch a picture of the dam, as shown in \hyperref[F-6-4-DamEx]{Figure~\ref{F-6-4-DamEx}}. Note that, as in problems involving the work to pump out a tank, we let the positive \(x\)-axis point down.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.73\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/6_4_DamEx.pdf}
\caption{A trapezoidal dam that is 25 feet tall, 60 feet wide at its base, 90 feet wide at its top, with the water line 5 feet down from the top of its face.\label{F-6-4-DamEx}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-7255}{}%
Pressure is constant at a fixed depth, so we consider a slice of water at constant depth on the face, as shown in the figure. The area of this slice is approximately the area of the rectangle pictured. Since the width of that rectangle depends on the variable \(x\), we find a formula for the line that represents one side of the dam. It is straightforward to find that \(y = 45 - \frac{3}{5}x\). Hence, the approximate area of a representative slice is%
\begin{equation*}
A_{\text{slice} } = 2 f(x) \Delta x = 2 (45 - \frac{3}{5}x) \Delta x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7256}{}%
At any point on this slice, the depth is approximately constant, so the pressure can be considered constant. Because the water rises to within 5 feet of the top of the dam, the depth of any point on the representative slice is approximately \((x-5)\). Now, since pressure is given by \(P = 62.4d\), we have that at any point on the slice%
\begin{equation*}
P_{\text{slice} } = 62.4(x-5)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7257}{}%
Knowing both the pressure and area, we can find the force the water exerts on the slice. Using \(F = PA\), it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
F_{\text{slice} } = P_{\text{slice} } \cdot A_{\text{slice} } = 62.4(x-5) \cdot 2 (45 - \frac{3}{5}x) \Delta x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7258}{}%
Finally, we use a definite integral to sum the forces over the appropriate range of \(x\)-values. Since the water rises to within 5 feet of the top of the dam, we start at \(x = 5\) and take slices all the way to the bottom of the dam, where \(x = 30\). Hence,%
\begin{equation*}
F = \int_{x=5}^{x=25} 62.4(x-5) \cdot 2 (45 - \frac{3}{5}x) \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7259}{}%
Using technology to evaluate the integral, we find \(F = 848 640\) pounds.%

We let the positive \(x\)-axis point down and let \(x\) be the distance from the top of the dam. The area of a typical horizontal slice (in square feet) is%
\begin{equation*}
A_{\text{ slice } } = 100 \Delta x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
The pressure (in pounds per square foot) at depth \(x\) is given by \(P_{\text{ slice } } = 62.5 x\). So the force on a typical slice (in pounds) is%
\begin{equation*}
F_{\text{ slice } } = (62.4x)(100 \Delta x) = 6240 x \Delta x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
So the force of the water against the dam is%
\begin{equation*}
F = \int_{x = 0}^{x=50} (6240 x) dx = 7~800~000 \text{ pounds }\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-4643}{}\hypertarget{p-7275}{}%
We let the positive \(x\)-axis point down and let \(x\) be the distance from the top of the dam. We place the top of the dam along the \(x\)-axis with the center at the origin. So the equation for the semicircle is \(y = \sqrt{30^2 - x^2} = \sqrt{900 - x^2}\). The area of a typical horizontal slice (in square feet) is%
\begin{equation*}
A_{\text{ slice } } = 2y \Delta x = 2 \sqrt{900 - x^2} \Delta x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
At a given value of \(x\), the depth of the water is \((x - 4)\). So the pressure (in pounds per square foot) at  \(x\) is given by \(P_{\text{ slice } } = 62.4 (x - 4)\). So the force on a typical slice (in pounds) is%
\begin{equation*}
F_{\text{ slice } } = 62.4(x - 4) \left(2 \sqrt{900 - x^2} \Delta x \right) = 124.8 (x - 4)\sqrt{900 - x^2} \Delta x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
So the force of the water against the dam is%
\begin{equation*}
F = \int_{x=4}^{x=30} 124.8 (x - 4)\sqrt{900 - x^2} dx = 800~244 \text{ pounds }\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-4644}{}\hypertarget{p-7276}{}%
We let the positive \(x\)-axis point down and let \(x\) be the distance from the top of the dam. We place the top of the trough along the \(x\)-axis with the center at the origin. We need the equation for the straight line from the point \((0, 2.5)\) to the point \((4, 0)\). The equation for this line is \(y = -\frac{5}{8}x + 2.5 = 2.5 - 0.625x\). The area of a typical horizontal slice (in square feet) is%
\begin{equation*}
A_{\text{ slice } } = 2y \Delta x = 2(2.5 - 0.625x) \Delta x = (5 - 1.25x)  \Delta x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
At a given value of \(x\), the depth of the water is \((x - 1)\). So the pressure (in pounds per square foot) at  \(x\) is given by \(P_{\text{ slice } } = 62.4 (x - 1)\). So the force on a typical slice (in pounds) is%
\begin{equation*}
F_{\text{ slice } } = 62.4(x - 1) \left( 5 - 1.25x \Delta x \right) = 62.4 (x - 1)(5 - 1.25x) \Delta x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
So the force of the water against the trough is%
\begin{equation*}
F = \int_{x=1}^{x=4} 62.4 (x - 1)(5 - 1.25x) dx = 351 \text{ pounds }\text{.}

Although there are many different formulas involving work, force, and pressure, the fundamental ideas behind these problems are similar to others we've encountered in applications of the definite integral.

Because work is computed as the product of force and distance (provided force is constant), and the force water exerts on a dam can be computed as the product of pressure and area (provided pressure is constant), problems involving these concepts are similar to earlier problems we did using definite integrals to find distance (via ``distance equals rate times time'') and mass (``mass equals density times volume'').%

We now suppose that the resulting tank is filled to a depth of \(1.5\) feet with water weighing \(62.4\) pounds per cubic foot. Since the bottom of the tank is at \(1.84527\), being full to a depth of \(1.5\) feet means that there is water from \(x = 0.34527\) to \(x = 1.84527\). To find the work done to pump the water until \(0.5\) feet remain in the tank (i.e. to a level where \(x = 1.34527\)), we have to first find the weight of a typical slice, which requires us to know the volume of such a slice. Observe that for a slice at depth \(x\),%
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{slice}} \approx \pi \left( 3\cos \left( \frac{x^3}{4} \right) \right)^2 \triangle x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Since water weighs \(62.4\) pounds per cubic foot, the weight (and thus force to be exerted) of such a slice is%
\begin{equation*}
F_{\text{slice}} \approx 62.4 \cdot 9 \cdot \pi \cos^2 \left( \frac{x^3}{4} \right) \triangle x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Finally, the work done to pump such a slice to the top of the tank requires the slice to move \(x\) units, and thus work for that slice is%
\begin{equation*}
W_{\text{slice}} \approx x \cdot 561.6 \pi \cos^2 \left( \frac{x^3}{4} \right) \triangle x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
To find the total work accomplished, we use a definite integral to sum the work done on each slice from \(x = 0.34527\) (the top of the water when the tank is initially full to \(1.84527\) feet) to \(x = 1.34527\) (the height of the water after \(1\) foot has been emptied). Thus,%
\begin{equation*}
W = \int_{0.34527}^{1.34527}  561.6 \pi \cos^2 \left( \frac{x^3}{4} \right) \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Evaluating the integral, we find \(W \approx 1646.79\) foot-pounds.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4655}{}\hypertarget{p-7293}{}%
If instead we envision the tank not as a solid of revolution but as a trough, where the two-dimensional figure above forms one end of a tank that is 10 feet long, we now have a similar problem but with slices that are thin rectangular slabs, rather than thin cylindrical disks. Note that each such slice is \(2 f(x)\) wide, \(10\) feet long, and \(\triangle x\) thick. Thus, for a slice at depth \(x\),%
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{slice}} \approx 2 \left( 3\cos \left( \frac{x^3}{4} \right) \right) \cdot 10 \cdot \triangle x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Since water weighs \(62.4\) pounds per cubic foot, the weight (and thus force to be exerted) of such a slice is%
\begin{equation*}
F_{\text{slice}} \approx 62.4 \cdot 60 \cos \left( \frac{x^3}{4} \right) \triangle x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Finally, the work done to pump such a slice to the top of the tank requires the slice to move \(x\) units, and thus work for that slice is%
\begin{equation*}
W_{\text{slice}} \approx x \cdot 3744 \cos \left( \frac{x^3}{4} \right) \triangle x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Assuming that the tank is completely full, to lower the tank by \(h\) feet, we consider slices from \(x = 0\) to \(x = h\), and thus using a definite integral to sum the work required for each slice, we find that the total work is%
\begin{equation*}
W = \int_0^h  3744 x \cos \left( \frac{x^3}{4} \right) \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-4656}{}\hypertarget{p-7294}{}%
For the trough described in (b), we now seek to find the total hydrostatic force on one of the ends of the tank when it is completely full. First, we note that a typical slice at location \(x\) will be at a depth of \(x\) feet below the water and have area%
\begin{equation*}
A_{\text{slice}} \approx 2 f(x) \triangle x = 2 \left( 3\cos \left( \frac{x^3}{4} \right) \right) \triangle x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
At any point on this slice, which again lies at depth \(x\), the pressure exerted is%
\begin{equation*}
P_{\text{slice}} \approx 62.4 x
\end{equation*}
since pressure is the weight density of water times depth. Finally, since \(F = P \cdot A\), the total force water is exerting on this slice is%
\begin{equation*}
F_{\text{slice}} = P_{\text{slice}} \cdot A_{\text{slice}} \approx 62.4 x \cdot 6 \cos \left( \frac{x^3}{4} \right) \triangle x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Integrating to sum the total force, we find that%
\begin{equation*}
F = \int_0^{1.84527} 374.4 x \cos \left( \frac{x^3}{4} \right) \, dx \approx 462.637

First, we set up axes and a sketch for one of the ends of the cylindrical tank. It is simplest to let ground level correspond to the (horizontal) \(y\)-axis with the positive \(x\)-axis pointing straight down, so that \(x = 0\) corresponds to ground level and the value of \(x\) tells us the depth of a particular location. The circular end of the tank has radius \(3\) and is centered at the point \((5,0)\) since its top is \(2\) feet underground. Thus, the equation of that circle is%
\begin{equation*}
(x-5)^2 + y^2 = 3^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Solving for \(y\), we find the equation of one half of the circle, the half that is pictured at right in the figure below: \(y = f(x) = \sqrt{9 - (x-5)^2}\).%

Next, for a slice at depth \(x\), its shape is a rectangular slab with thickness \(\triangle x\). Its length is \(10\), and its width is \(2 f(x) = 2 \sqrt{9 - (x-5)^2}\). Thus, the volume of such a slice is%
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{slice}} \approx 10 \cdot  2 \sqrt{9 - (x-5)^2} \cdot \triangle x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
With the water weighing \(62.4\) pounds per cubic foot, the weight of (and thus force to be exerted upon) a typical slice is%
\begin{equation*}
F_{\text{slice}} \approx 262.4 \cdot 20 \sqrt{9 - (x-5)^2} \triangle x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
To move such a slice from its depth \(x\) feet below the ground to a tank on a truck that's \(4.5\) feet above ground, each slice must travel \(x + 4.5\) feet, and thus the work to move the slice is%
\begin{equation*}
W_{\text{slice}} \approx (x+4.5) 5248 \sqrt{9 - (x-5)^2} \triangle x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Finally, to empty half the tank, we need to consider slices from \(x = 2\) to \(x = 5\), and thus using a definite integral to sum the work required for each slice, we get%
\begin{equation*}
W = \int_2^5 5248 (x+4.5) \sqrt{9 - (x-5)^2} \, dx = 5904(19\pi - 8) \approx 305179.3
\end{equation*}
foot-pounds.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4662}{}\hypertarget{p-7304}{}%
To find the hydrostatic force due to water pressure that is exerted on one end of the tank by the remaining water, we first find the area of a rectangular slice at a location \(x\), which is%
\begin{equation*}
A_{\text{slice}} \approx 2 f(x) \triangle x = 2 \sqrt{9 - (x-5)^2} \triangle x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
We note that such a slice lies between \(x = 5\) and \(x = 8\), which is the values of \(x\) that represent the depths of remaining water from top to bottom. At an \(x\) in this interval, the slice's depth below the surface of the water is \(x - 5\). Thus, since pressure is weight-density times depth, it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
P_{\text{slice}} \approx 62.4 (x-5)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Finally, since \(F = P \cdot A\), the total force water is exerting on this slice is%
\begin{equation*}
F_{\text{slice}} = P_{\text{slice}} \cdot A_{\text{slice}} \approx 62.4 (x-5) \cdot 2 \sqrt{9 - (x-5)^2}  \triangle x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Integrating to sum the total force, we find%
\begin{equation*}
F = \int_5^8 124.8 (x-5) \sqrt{9 - (x-5)^2} \, dx \approx 1123.2
\end{equation*}
pounds.%

Sequences of integers are of such interest to mathematicians and others that they have a journal\footnote{\textsl{The Journal of Integer Sequences} at \url{http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/}\label{fn-71}} devoted to them and an online encyclopedia\footnote{The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences at \url{http://oeis.org/}\label{fn-72}} that catalogs a huge number of integer sequences and their connections.

Our studies in calculus have dealt with continuous functions. Sequences model \emph{discrete} instead of continuous information. We will study ways to represent and work with discrete information in this chapter as we investigate \emph{sequences} and \emph{series}, and ultimately see key connections between the discrete and continuous.%

Suppose you receive \(\$5,\!000\) through an inheritance. You decide to invest this money into a fund that pays \(8\%\) annually, compounded monthly. That means that each month your investment earns \(\frac{0.08}{12} \cdot P\) additional dollars, where \(P\) is your principal balance at the start of the month. So in the first month your investment earns%
\begin{equation*}
5000 \left(\frac{0.08}{12}\right)
\end{equation*}
or \(\$ 33.33\). If you reinvest this money, you will then have \(\$ 5033.33\) in your account at the end of the first month. From this point on, assume that you reinvest all of the interest you earn.%

You may notice some small difference in your results from the formula, due to the way rounding happens in each method. To compute the balance in the account after 5 years, we can use the formula with \(n=60\) months, to get%
\begin{equation*}
P_{60}=5000\left(1+\frac{.08}{12}\right)^{60} = \$7449.23.
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-4673}{}\hypertarget{p-7321}{}%
The goal is to find the time it takes for the account to reach a balance of \(\$ 10,\!000\). To do this, we can use the formula, and filling in everything we know, we have%
\begin{equation*}
10000=5000\left(1+\frac{.08}{12}\right)^n.
\end{equation*}
We can then solve for the number of months as follows:%
\begin{align*}
10000 \amp = 5000\left(1+\frac{.08}{12}\right)^n\\
2 \amp = \left(1+\frac{.08}{12}\right)^n\\
\ln (2) \amp = n \ln \left(1+\frac{.08}{12}\right)\\
\frac{\ln (2)}{\ln\left(1+\frac{.08}{12}\right)} \amp = n \text{.}
\end{align*}
This gives us that the number of months until the account reaches \(\$ 10,\!000\) is \(\frac{\ln (2)}{\ln\left(1+\frac{.08}{12}\right)} \approx 104.3 \). This amounts to about \(8.7\) years.%

\hypertarget{p-7322}{}%
As \hyperref[PA-8-1]{Example~\ref{PA-8-1}} illustrates, many discrete phenomena can be represented as lists of numbers (like the amount of money in an account over a period of months). We call any such list a \terminology{sequence}. A sequence is nothing more than list of terms in some order. We often list the entries of the sequence with subscripts,%
\begin{equation*}
s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n, \ldots\text{,}
\end{equation*}
where the subscript denotes the position of the entry in the sequence.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7323}{}%
\begin{assemblage}[Sequence]\label{assemblage-150}
\hypertarget{p-7324}{}%
A \terminology{sequence} is a list of terms \(s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots\) in a specified order.%
\end{assemblage}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7325}{}%
We can think of a sequence as a function \(f\) whose domain is the set of positive integers where \(f(n) = s_n\) for each positive integer \(n\). This alternative view will be be useful in many situations.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7326}{}%
We often denote the sequence \(s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots\) by \(\{s_n\}\). The value \(s_n\) (alternatively \(s(n)\)) is called the \(n\)th \terminology{term} \index{sequence!term} in the sequence. If the terms are all 0 after some fixed value of \(n\), we say the sequence is finite. Otherwise the sequence is infinite.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7327}{}%
We often define sequences using formulas, which can be explicit or recursive. Explicit formulas write the term \(s_n\) in terms of \(n\), while recursive formulas write \(s_n\) in terms of the earlier entries in the sequence. Often, explicit formulas are easier to work with because they can be used to directly find any term in the sequence.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-304}
\hypertarget{p-7328}{}%
Given the explicit sequence formula \(s_n=\frac{3n-1}{n+2}\), find \(s_1, s_2, s_{10}\), and \(s_{1000}\).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-396}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-7329}{}%
Since the formula is explicit, we simply substitute in the appropriate value for \(n\).%
\begin{equation*}
s_1= \frac{3(1)-1}{1+2}=\frac{2}{3}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
s_2=\frac{3(2)-1}{2+2}=\frac{5}{4}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
s_{10}=\frac{3(10)-1}{10+2}=\frac{29}{12}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
s_{1000}=\frac{3(1000)-1}{1000+2}=\frac{2999}{1002}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-7330}{}%
Recursively defined sequences, on the other hand, use a formula that relies on previous terms in the sequence and requires some of the first few terms to be set to get started.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-305}

\begin{equation*}
s_2=s_{2-1}+2=s_1+2=2+2=4.
\end{equation*}
Similarly, to get \(s_3\) we'll need to know \(s_2\).%
\begin{align*}
s_3\amp=s_2+2=4+2=6,\\
s_4\amp=s_3+2=6+2=8,\\

\item\hypertarget{li-4678}{}\hypertarget{p-7337}{}%
This formula says that each term is the previous term multiplied by -2. We have%

We recall that a function \(f\)  diverges to infinity (and hence does not have a limit\footnote{Limits \textemdash{} when they exist \textemdash{} are inherently finite. This is true even though we sometimes use the notation ``\(\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}f(x)=\infty\)'' to mean that a function increases without bound.\label{fn-73}} as \(x\to\infty\)) if we can make the values of \(f(x)\) as large as we want by choosing large enough values of \(x\). Since we can make the values of \(n\) in our sequence as large as we want by choosing \(n\) to be arbitrarily large, we suspect that this sequence does not have a limit as \(n\) goes to infinity. The fact that \(\lim\limits_{x\to\infty}x=\infty\) supports this reasoning.%

\item\hypertarget{li-4704}{}\hypertarget{p-7378}{}%
As \(n\) gets large, the constant terms become infinitesimally small compared to \(n\) and so \(\frac{1+n}{2+n}\) looks like \(\frac{n}{n}\) or 1 for large \(n\). So the sequence \(\left\{ \frac{1+n}{2+n}\right\}\) has a limit of 1 at infinity.%

More rigorously, we can either write \(\frac{1+n}{2+n}=1-\frac1{2+n}\) and note that \(\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\frac1{2+n}=0\), or we can apply L'Hopital's rule to the function \(f(x)=\frac{1+x}{2+x}\) as \(x\to\infty\) to assert that \(\left\{\frac{1+n}{2+n}\right\}\) has limit \(1\) as \(n\to\infty\).%

\hypertarget{p-7381}{}%
\begin{assemblage}[Sequence Convergence]\label{assemblage-151}
\hypertarget{p-7382}{}%
A sequence \(\{ s_n \}\) \terminology{converges} \index{converge!sequence} \index{sequence!converge} or is a \terminology{convergent sequence} \index{convergent sequence} provided that there is a number \(L\) such that we can make \(s_n\) as close to \(L\) as we want by taking \(n\) sufficiently large. In this situation, we call \(L\) the \terminology{limit} \index{sequence!limit} of the convergent sequence and write%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{n \to \infty} s_n = L\text{.}
\end{equation*}
If the sequence \(\{s_n\}\) does not converge, we say that the sequence \(\{s_n\}\) \terminology{diverges}. \index{diverge!sequence} \index{sequence!diverge}%

\par
\hypertarget{p-7383}{}%
The idea of sequence having a limit as \(n \to \infty\) is the same as the idea of a continuous function having a limit as \(x \to \infty\). The only difference is that sequences are discrete instead of continuous.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7384}{}%
We will apply the same terminology from limits of continuous functions to the limits of discrete functions. For example, we will say that a sequence converges to a limit \(L\) \emph{from below} if the terms of the sequence are smaller than \(L\), and \emph{from above} if the terms of the sequence are larger than \(L\).%

The plot implies that the sequence does not have a limit as \(n\) goes to infinity. Evaluating the limit algebraically, we factor \(3^n\) from the numerator and \(2^n\) from the denominator. Doing so yields%
\begin{equation*}
\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\frac{5+3^n}{10+2^n}=\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\frac{3^n\left(\frac{5}{3^n}+1\right)}{2^n\left(\frac{10}{2^n}+1\right)}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Now, since \(\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\frac{\frac5{3^n}+1}{\frac{10}{2^n}+1}=1\), it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\frac{3^n\left(\frac{5}{3^n}+1\right)}{2^n\left(\frac{10}{2^n}+1\right)}=\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}\left(\frac32\right)^n\text{.}
\end{equation*}
 Since \(\frac{3}{2} \gt 1\), this limit is infinite and the sequence \(\left\{\frac{5+3^n}{10+2^n}\right\}\) diverges to infinity as the plot suggests.%

Initially, it looks as though the terms increase without bound, but beginning at about \(n=10\) the factorial in the denominator dominates the numerator. Notice that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{10^n}{n!} = \frac{10 \times 10 \times 10 \times \cdots \times 10}{1 \times 2 \times 3 \times \cdots \times n}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
When \(n \gt 20\), we have that \(\frac{10}{n} \lt  \frac{1}{2}\) and thus%
\begin{align*}
\frac{10^n}{n!} \amp = \left(\frac{10 \times 10 \times 10 \times \cdots \times 10}{1 \times 2 \times 3 \times \cdots\times 20}\right) \left(\frac{10 \times 10 \times 10 \times \cdots \times 10}{21 \times 22 \times 23 \times \cdots\times n}\right)\\
\amp = \left(\frac{10^{20}}{20!}\right) \left(\frac{10}{21}\right) \left(\frac{10}{22}\right) \cdots \left(\frac{10}{n}\right)\\
\amp \lt  \left(\frac{10^{20}}{20!}\right) \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n-20}\text{.}
\end{align*}
Since \(\frac{1}{2}\lt 1\), the term \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n-20}\) goes to 0 as \(n\) goes to infinity. The fact that \(\frac{10^{20}}{20!}\) is a constant means that \(\frac{10^n}{n!} \to 0\) as \(n \to \infty\).%

A sequence \(\{s_n\}\) of real numbers converges to a number \(L\) if \textemdash{} by choosing \(n\) sufficiently large \textemdash{} we can make every value of \(s_k\) as close as we want to \(L\), for \(k \ge n\).%

\item\hypertarget{li-4768}{}\hypertarget{p-7475}{}%

From the behavior of exponential functions, we know that if \(0 \lt a \lt 1\), then \(a^x \to 0\) as \(x \to \infty\). It follows that \(\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n \to 0\) as \(n \to \infty\), and therefore \(A_n \to 0\) as time goes on. This makes sense because the human body will consume and change the drug in the body and eliminate it unless additional doses are taken.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4771}{}\hypertarget{p-7478}{}%
To determine the time at which \(1\) gram of the hormone remains in the body, we solve the equation%
\begin{equation*}
1 = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n \cdot 100\text{.}
\end{equation*}
This implies that \(\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n = 0.01\), and thus \(n = \frac{\ln(0.01)}{\ln(0.5)} \approx 6.6439\). Thus, it takes about \(6.6439\) half-lives to elapse to get down to \(1\) gram remaining, or \(5 \cdot 6.6439 = 33.2193\) minutes.%

\item[8.]\hypertarget{exercise-438}{}(Sampling Continuous Data)\space\space{}\hypertarget{p-7479}{}%
Continuous data is the basis for analog information, like music stored on old cassette tapes or vinyl records. A digital signal like on a CD or MP3 file is obtained by sampling an analog signal at some regular time interval and storing that information. For example, the sampling rate of a compact disk is 44,100 samples per second. So a digital recording is only an approximation of the actual analog information. Digital information can be manipulated in many useful ways that allow for, among other things, noisy signals to be cleaned up and large collections of information to be compressed and stored in much smaller space. While we won't investigate these techniques in this chapter, this exercise is intended to give an idea of the importance of discrete (digital) techniques.%
\par

Let \(f\) be the continuous function defined by \(f(x) = \sin(4x)\) on the interval \([0,10]\). A graph of \(f\) is shown in \hyperref[F-8-1-PA1]{Figure~\ref{F-8-1-PA1}}.%

\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-7481}{}%
We approximate \(f\) by \emph{sampling}, that is by partitioning the interval \([0,10]\) into uniform subintervals and recording the values of \(f\) at the endpoints. \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-4772}{}\hypertarget{p-7482}{}%
Ineffective sampling can lead to several problems in reproducing the original signal. As an example, partition the interval \([0,10]\) into 8 equal length subintervals and create a list of points (the \emph{sample}) using the endpoints of each subinterval. Plot your sample on graph of \(f\) in Figure \hyperref[F-8-1-PA1]{Figure~\ref{F-8-1-PA1}}. What can you say about the period of your sample as compared to the period of the original function?%
\item\hypertarget{li-4773}{}\hypertarget{p-7483}{}%
The sampling rate is the number of samples of a signal taken per second. As the part (a) illustrates, sampling at too small a rate can cause serious problems with reproducing the original signal (this problem of inefficient sampling leading to an inaccurate approximation is called \emph{aliasing}). There is an elegant theorem called the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem that says that human perception is limited, which allows that replacement of a continuous signal with a digital one without any perceived loss of information. This theorem also provides the \emph{lowest} rate at which a signal can be sampled (called the Nyquist rate) without such a loss of information. The theorem states that we should sample at double the maximum desired frequency so that every cycle of the original signal will be sampled at at least two points. Recall that the frequency of a sinusoidal function is the reciprocal of the period. Identify the frequency of the function \(f\) and determine the number of partitions of the interval \([0,10]\) that give us the Nyquist rate.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4774}{}\hypertarget{p-7484}{}%
Humans cannot typically pick up signals above 20 kHz. Explain why, then, that information on a compact disk is sampled at 44,100 Hz.%

Since the period of the function \(f(x) = \sin(4x)\) is \(P = \frac{\pi}{2}\), its frequency is \(\frac{2}{\pi} \approx 0.6366\), which means that this function completes about \(0.6366\) cycles per second. Doubling this frequncy gives us a value of \(\frac{4}{\pi} \approx 1.2732\). This means that we should sample the function at at least a rate of twice per cycle, or at least \(1.2732\) samples per second. On a 10-second interval, we therefore need at least \(13\) samples, so we should do so at least every \(10/13 \approx 0.76923\) seconds.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4780}{}\hypertarget{p-7492}{}%
Since the theorem says to sample at a minimum of double the maximum desired frequency, and humans can't detect signals above \(20\) KHz, it follows that double \(20\) KHz is \(40\) KHz, or \(40000\) Hz, so sampling at \(44100\) Hz slightly exceeds the minimum sampling needed by the formal result.%

Warfarin is an anticoagulant that prevents blood clotting; often it is prescribed to stroke victims in order to help ensure blood flow. The level of warfarin has to reach a certain concentration in the blood in order to be effective.%

Suppose warfarin is taken by a particular patient in a 5 mg dose each day. The drug is absorbed by the body and some is excreted from the system between doses. Assume that at the end of a 24 hour period, 8\% of the drug remains in the body. Let \(Q(n)\) be the amount (in mg) of warfarin in the body before the \((n+1)\)st dose of the drug is administered.%

After the first dose and just before the second dose, \(8\%\) of the first 5 mg dose remains. Thus, \(Q(1)=5 \rtimes 0.08 \) mg.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4799}{}\hypertarget{p-7514}{}%
When the second dose is adminstered, the amount of drug in the body is the new 5 mg in addition to the residual amount remaining from the first dose, or \(5 + Q(1)\) mg. After 24 hours, the remaining amount is \(8\%\) of this total amount. So%
\begin{equation*}
Q(2)=(5+Q(1))(0.08)
\end{equation*}
Now plugging in \(Q(1)\) from part a., we have%
\begin{align*}
Q(2) \amp =(5+Q(1))(0.08) \\
\amp = (5+5(0.08))(0.08) \\
\amp = 5(0.08)+5(0.08)^2 \\
\amp = 5(0.08)(1+0.08)

where in the last line, we factor out 5(0.08) from each term.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4800}{}\hypertarget{p-7515}{}%
Similarly, just before the third dose, the amount in the body is \(8/%\) of the total from the previous day, which is \(Q(2)+5\). We can use similar algebra to the previous part:%
\begin{align*}
Q(3)\amp=(5+Q(2))(0.08) \\
\amp=(5+5(0.08)(1+0.08))(0.08)\\
\amp=5(0.08) + 5(0.08)(0.08+0.08^2)\\

Q(n)=(5 \times 0.08)\left(1+0.08+0.08^2+0.08^3+ \cdots + 0.08^{n-1}\right) \text{mg}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
so \(Q(n)\) is a geometric series with \(a=5 \times 0.08 = 0.4\) and \(r = 0.08\). Thus,%
\begin{equation*}
Q(n) = 0.4\left(\frac{1-0.08^n}{1-0.08}\right) = \frac{1}{2.3} \left(1-0.08^n\right)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7542}{}%
Notice that as \(n\) goes to infinity, the value of \(0.08^n\) goes to 0. So,%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{n \to \infty} Q(n) = \lim_{n \to \infty}  \frac{1}{2.3} \left(1-0.08^n\right) = \frac{1}{2.3} \approx 0.435\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7543}{}%
Therefore, the long-term level of Warfarin in the blood under these conditions is \(\frac{1}{2.3}\), which is approximately 0.435 mg.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7544}{}%
To determine the long-term effect of Warfarin, we considered a finite geometric series of \(n\) terms, and then considered what happened as \(n\) was allowed to grow without bound. In this sense, we were actually interested in an infinite geometric series (the result of letting \(n\) go to infinity in the finite sum). \index{geometric series} \index{series!geometric}%
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{definition-3}
\hypertarget{p-7545}{}%
An infinite geometric series is an infinite sum of the form%
\begin{equation}
a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} ar^n\text{.}\label{eq-8-2-geometric-series}
\end{equation}
%
\end{definition}
\hypertarget{p-7546}{}%
The value of \(r\) in the geometric series \hyperref[eq-8-2-geometric-series]{(\ref{eq-8-2-geometric-series})} is called the \emph{common ratio} \index{geometric series!common ratio} of the series because the ratio of the (\(n+1\))st term, \(ar^n\), to the \(n\)th term, \(ar^{n-1}\), is always \(r\):%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{ar^n}{ar^{n-1}} = r\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7547}{}%
Geometric series are common in mathematics and arise naturally in many different situations. As a familiar example, suppose we want to write the number with repeating decimal expansion%
\begin{equation*}
N=0.1212\overline{12}
\end{equation*}
as a rational number. Observe that%
\begin{align*}
N \amp =  0.12 + 0.0012 + 0.000012 + \cdots\\
\amp = \left(\frac{12}{100}\right) + \left(\frac{12}{100}\right)\left(\frac{1}{100}\right) + \left(\frac{12}{100}\right)\left(\frac{1}{100}\right)^2 + \cdots\text{.}
\end{align*}
This is an infinite geometric series with \(a=\frac{12}{100}\) and \(r = \frac{1}{100}\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7548}{}%
By using the formula for the value of a finite geometric sum, we can also develop a formula for the value of an infinite geometric series. We explore this idea in the following example.%
\begin{example}[]\label{act-8-2-2}
\hypertarget{p-7549}{}%
Let \(r \ne 1\) and \(a\) be real numbers and let%
\begin{equation*}
S = a+ar+ar^2 + \cdots ar^{n-1} + \cdots
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
S_n = a+ar+ar^2 + \cdots + ar^{n-1}\text{.}
\end{equation*}

The sum of a finite number of terms of an infinite geometric series is often called a \emph{partial sum} \index{partial sum} of the series. Thus,%
\begin{equation*}
S_n = a+ar+ar^2 + \cdots + ar^{n-1} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ar^k\text{.}
\end{equation*}
is called the \(n\)th partial sum of the series \(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} ar^k\). We summarize our recent work with geometric series as follows.%
\begin{assemblage}[Infinite Geometric Series]\label{assemblage-158}
\hypertarget{p-7568}{}%

\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-7569}{}%
An \terminology{infinite geometric series} is an infinite sum of the form%
\begin{equation}
a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} ar^n\text{,}\label{eq-8-2-geometric-series-2}
\end{equation}
where \(a\) and \(r\) are real numbers such that \(r \ne 0\).%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-7570}{}%
The \(n\)th partial sum \(S_n\) of an infinite geometric series is%
\begin{equation*}
S_n = a+ar+ar^2+ \cdots + ar^{n-1}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-7571}{}%
If \(|r| \lt  1\), then using the fact that \(S_n = a\frac{1-r^n}{1-r}\), it follows that the sum \(S\) of the infinite geometric series \hyperref[eq-8-2-geometric-series-2]{(\ref{eq-8-2-geometric-series-2})} is%
\begin{equation*}
S = \lim_{n \to \infty} S_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} a\frac{1-r^n}{1-r} = \frac{a}{1-r}.
\end{equation*}
In this case we say that the geometric series \terminology{converges}.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-7572}{}%
If \(|r|\geq1\), the sequence \(S_n\) does not converge, so we can't assign a numerical value to the expression \(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} ar^n\). In this case we say that the geometric series does not converge.%
\end{itemize}
%
\end{assemblage}
\begin{example}[]\label{act-8-2-3}
\hypertarget{p-7573}{}%
The formulas we have derived for an infinite geometric series and its partial sum have assumed that we begin indexing the sums at \(n=0\). If instead we have a sum that does not begin at \(n=0\), we can factor out common terms and then use the established formulas. This process is illustrated in this example.%

Suppose you drop a golf ball onto a hard surface from a height \(h\). The collision with the ground causes the ball to lose energy and so it will not bounce back to its original height. The ball will then fall again to the ground, bounce back up, and continue. Assume that at each bounce the ball rises back to a height \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the height from which it dropped. Let \(h_n\) be the height of the ball on the \(n\)th bounce, with \(h_0 = h\).

\item\hypertarget{li-4887}{}\hypertarget{p-7642}{}%
There are \(6\) equally possible outcomes when we roll one die, and only one of those is a \(6\), so the probability that a \(6\) appears when we roll the die is \(\frac{1}{6}\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-4888}{}\hypertarget{p-7643}{}%
On the first roll, the probability of not rolling a \(6\) is \(\frac{5}{6}\). This is the same on the second roll, so the probability of not rolling a \(6\) on either of the first two rolls is \(\frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{5}{6}\), since the two events are independent. If we then roll a \(6\) on the following turn, the probability of doing so in that roll is \(\frac{1}{6}\), so with the three rolls being independent, the probability of you rolling a \(6\) on your second turn (the third overall roll) is%
\begin{equation*}
P = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right) \left( \frac{5}{6} \right) \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)\text{.}

%
\item\hypertarget{li-4890}{}\hypertarget{p-7645}{}%
By simply summing the probabilities to consider all of the possible outcomes (rolling \(6\) on your first turn, doing so on your second, etc.), we get that the total probability of you rolling a \(6\) on one of your turns is%
\begin{equation*}
P = \frac{1}{6} + \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2\left(\frac{1}{6}\right) +  \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4\left(\frac{1}{6}\right) + \cdots\text{,}
\end{equation*}
which is a geometric series with \(a = \frac{1}{6}\) and \(r = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2\). Since we know that a geometric series has sum \(S = \frac{a}{1-r}\), it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
P = \frac{\frac{1}{6}}{1 - \frac{25}{36}} = \frac{\frac{6}{36}}{\frac{11}{36}} = \frac{6}{11}\text{,}

so by going first your odds are just slightly better than half that you'll be the first one to roll a \(6\).%

The goal of a federal government stimulus package is to positively affect the economy. Economists and politicians quote numbers like ``\(k\) million jobs and a net stimulus to the economy of \(n\) billion of dollars.'' Where do they get these numbers? Let's consider one aspect of a stimulus package: tax cuts. Economists understand that tax cuts or rebates can result in long-term spending that is many times the amount of the rebate. For example, assume that for a typical person, 75\% of her entire income is spent (that is, put back into the economy). Further, assume the government provides a tax cut or rebate that totals \(P\) dollars for each person.%

\item[10.]\hypertarget{exercise-450}{}(Computing loan payments using geometric series)\space\space{}\hypertarget{p-7663}{}%
Like stimulus packages, home mortgages and foreclosures also impact the economy. A problem for many borrowers is the adjustable rate mortgage, in which the interest rate can change (and usually increases) over the duration of the loan, causing the monthly payments to increase beyond the ability of the borrower to pay. Most financial analysts recommend fixed rate loans, ones for which the monthly payments remain constant throughout the term of the loan. In this exercise we will analyze fixed rate loans.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7664}{}%
When most people buy a large ticket item like car or a house, they have to take out a loan to make the purchase. The loan is paid back in monthly installments until the entire amount of the loan, plus interest, is paid. With a loan, we borrow money, say \(P\) dollars (called the principal), and pay off the loan at an interest rate of \(r\)\%. To pay back the loan we make regular monthly payments, some of which goes to pay off the principal and some of which is charged as interest. In most cases, the interest is computed based on the amount of principal that remains at the beginning of the month. We assume a fixed rate loan, that is one in which we make a constant monthly payment \(M\) on our loan, beginning in the original month of the loan.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7665}{}%
Suppose you want to buy a house. You have a certain amount of money saved to make a down payment, and you will borrow the rest to pay for the house. Of course, for the privilege of loaning you the money, the bank will charge you interest on this loan, so the amount you pay back to the bank is more than the amount you borrow. In fact, the amount you ultimately pay depends on three things: the amount you borrow (called the \emph{principal}), the interest rate, and the length of time you have to pay off the loan plus interest (called the \emph{duration} of the loan). For this example, we assume that the interest rate is fixed at \(r\)\%.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7666}{}%
To pay off the loan, each month you make a payment of the same amount (called \emph{installments}). Suppose we borrow \(P\) dollars (our principal) and pay off the loan at an interest rate of \(r\)\% with regular monthly installment payments of \(M\) dollars. So in month 1 of the loan, before we make any payments, our principal is \(P\) dollars. Our goal in this exercise is to find a formula that relates these three parameters to the time duration of the loan.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7667}{}%
We are charged interest every month at an annual rate of \(r\)\%, so each month we pay \(\frac{r}{12}\)\% interest on the principal that remains. Given that the original principal is \(P\) dollars, we will pay \(\left(\frac{0.01r}{12}\right)P\) dollars in interest on our first payment. Since we paid \(M\) dollars in total for our first payment, the remainder of the payment (\(M-\left(\frac{r}{12}\right)P\)) goes to pay down the principal. So the principal remaining after the first payment (let's call it \(P_1\)) is the original principal minus what we paid on the principal, or%
\begin{equation*}
P_1 = P - \left( M - \left(\frac{r}{12}\right)P\right) = \left(1 + \frac{r}{12}\right)P - M\text{.}

Now we consider larger loans, e.g., automobile loans or mortgages, in which we borrow a specified amount of money over a specified period of time. In this situation, we need to determine the amount of the monthly payment we need to make to pay off the loan in the specified amount of time. In this situation, we need to find the monthly payment \(M\) that will take our outstanding principal to \(0\) in the specified amount of time. To do so, we want to know the value of \(M\) that makes \(P(t) = 0\) in formula~\hyperref[eq-loan2]{(\ref{eq-loan2})}. If we set \(P(t) = 0\) and solve for \(M\), it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
M = \frac{rP \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t}}{12\left(\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t} - 1 \right)}\text{.}

In the second installment, we are charged \(\left(\frac{r}{12}\right)P_1\) dollars in interest.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4928}{}\hypertarget{p-7703}{}%
The amount of our payment \(M\) that doesn't go toward interest is applied toward the principal. So we reduce our principal by \(M-\left(\frac{r}{12}\right)P_1\) dollars. Therefore, the balance of our loan after the second installment is%
\begin{equation*}
P_2 = P_1 - \left( M - \left(\frac{r}{12}\right)P_1 \right) = \left(1 + \frac{r}{12}\right)P_1 - M\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-4929}{}\hypertarget{p-7704}{}%
We know \(P_2 = \left(1 + \frac{r}{12}\right)P_1 - M\), so we substitute for \(P_1\) and simplify:%
\begin{align*}
P_2 \amp = \left(1 + \frac{r}{12}\right)P_1 - M\\
\amp = \left(1 + \frac{r}{12}\right)\left[\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)P - M\right] - M\\

\end{align*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-4930}{}\hypertarget{p-7705}{}%
For the third payment we are charged \(\left(\frac{r}{12}\right)P_2\) dollars in interest. So \(M-\left(\frac{r}{12}\right)P_2\) dollars goes toward paying down the principal. Then%
\begin{equation*}
P_3 = P_2 - \left( M - \left(\frac{r}{12}\right)P_2 \right) = \left(1 + \frac{r}{12}\right)P_2 - M\text{.}

%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7706}{}%
So \(P_3 = \left(1 + \frac{r}{12}\right)P_2 - M\), so we substitute for \(P_2\) and simplify:%

The sum in \hyperref[eq-part-sum]{(\ref{eq-part-sum})} is a partial sum of the geometric series with ratio \(1+\frac{r}{12}\). So formula \hyperref[eq-8-2-part-sum-geometric]{(\ref{eq-8-2-part-sum-geometric})} shows that the partial sum \(\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^k\) is equal to%
\begin{align*}
\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^k \amp = \frac{1-\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^n}{1-\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)}\\
\amp = \left(\frac{12}{r}\right) \left(\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^n - 1\right)\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7708}{}%
Now we can determine that the remaining principal after \(n\) installments is%
\begin{align*}
P_n \amp = \left(1 + \frac{r}{12}\right)^nP - \left[\left(\frac{12}{r}\right) \left(\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^n - 1\right) \right] M\\
\amp = P \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^n - \left(\frac{12M}{r}\right) \left( \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^n - 1\right)\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-4932}{}\hypertarget{p-7709}{}%
To put our payments into a yearly context which is more convenient, we know that there are \(12t\) months in \(t\) years. So we can say that the principal \(P(t)\) remaining at the end of \(t\) years is%
\begin{equation}
P(t) = P \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t} - \left(\frac{12M}{r}\right) \left( \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t} - 1\right)\label{eq-loan1}
\end{equation}
which reduces to \hyperref[eq-loan2]{(\ref{eq-loan2})}.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4933}{}\hypertarget{p-7710}{}%
Under these conditions, the principal in the account at the end of \(t\) years will be%
\begin{equation*}
A(t) = \left(1000 - \frac{12(25)}{0.2}\right)\left(1+\frac{0.2}{12}\right)^{12t} + \frac{12(25)}{0.2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7711}{}%
To determine how long it will take us to pay off the card, we need to find the time so that \(A(t) = 0\). When \(A(t) = 0\) we have%
\begin{align*}
0 \amp = \left(1000 - \frac{12(25)}{0.2}\right)\left(1+\frac{0.2}{12}\right)^{12t} + \frac{12(25)}{0.2}\\
0 \amp = (-500)(1.0167)^{12t} + 1500\\
500(1.0167)^{12t} \amp = 1500\\
(1.0167)^{12t} \amp = 3\\
12t \ln(1.0167) \amp = \ln(3)\\
t \amp = \frac{\ln(3)}{12 \ln(1.0167)}\\
t \amp \approx 5.53\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7712}{}%
So it would take over 5.5 years to pay off the debt. At \textdollar{}25 per month, we will have paid approximately \(12 \times 5.5 \times 25 = 1{,}659\) dollars on our original \textdollar{}1,000 charge. In other words, we pay \textdollar{}659 dollars in interest on our \textdollar{}1000 loan.%
\item\hypertarget{li-4934}{}\hypertarget{p-7713}{}%
We need to find the value of \(M\) in our formula:%
\begin{equation*}
M = \frac{rP \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t}}{12\left(\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t} - 1 \right)} = \frac{(0.0625)(15000)\left(1+\frac{0.0625}{12}\right)^{60}}{12\left(\left(1+\frac{0.0625}{12}\right)^{60} - 1 \right)} \approx 291.74\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7714}{}%
So we need to pay \textdollar{}291.74 each month to complete the loan in 5 years. During that time we spend a total of \(12 \times 5 \times 291.74 = 17{,}504.40\) dollars on the loan or \textdollar{}2,504.40 in interest.%

In \hyperref[sec-7-2-geometric]{Section~\ref{sec-7-2-geometric}}, we encountered infinite geometric series. For example, by writing%
\begin{equation*}
N = 0.1212121212 \cdots = \frac{12}{100} + \frac{12}{100} \cdot \frac{1}{100} + \frac{12}{100} \cdot \frac{1}{100^2} + \cdots
\end{equation*}
as a geometric series, we found a way to write  \(N\) as a single fraction: \(N = \frac{4}{33}\). In this section, we explore other types of infinite sums. In \hyperref[PA-8-3]{Example~\ref{PA-8-3}} we see how one such sum is related to the famous number \(e\).%
\begin{example}[]\label{PA-8-3}
\hypertarget{p-7721}{}%
Have you ever wondered how your calculator can produce a numeric approximation for complicated numbers like \(e\), \(\pi\) or \(\ln(2)\)? After all, the only operations a calculator can really perform are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, the operations that make up polynomials. This example provides the first steps in understanding how this process works. Throughout the example, let \(f(x) = e^x\).%

Find the tangent line to \(f\) at \(x=0\) and use this linearization to approximate \(e\). That is, find a formula \(L(x)\) for the tangent line, and compute \(L(1)\), since \(L(1) \approx f(1) = e\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-4941}{}\hypertarget{p-7724}{}%
The linearization of \(e^x\) does not provide a good approximation to \(e\) since 1 is not very close to 0. To obtain a better approximation, we alter our approach a bit. Instead of using a straight line to approximate \(e\), we put an appropriate bend in our estimating function to make it better fit the graph of \(e^x\) for \(x\) close to 0. With the linearization, we had both \(f(x)\) and \(f'(x)\) share the same value as the linearization at \(x=0\). We will now use a quadratic approximation \(P_2(x)\) to \(f(x) = e^x\) centered at \(x=0\) which has the property that \(P_2(0) = f(0)\), \(P'_2(0) = f'(0)\), and \(P''_2(0) = f''(0)\).%

\item\hypertarget{li-4943}{}\hypertarget{p-7727}{}%
We can continue approximating \(e\) with polynomials of larger degree whose higher derivatives agree with those of \(f\) at 0. This turns out to make the polynomials fit the graph of \(f\) better for more values of \(x\) around 0. For example, let \(P_3(x) = 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^3}{6}\). Show that \(P_3(0) = f(0)\), \(P'_3(0) = f'(0)\), \(P''_3(0) = f''(0)\), and \(P'''_3(0) = f'''(0)\). Use \(P_3(x)\) to approximate \(e\) in a way similar to how you did so with \(P_2(x)\) above.%

We see an interesting pattern here. The number \(e\) is being approximated by the sum%
\begin{equation}
1+1+\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{24} + \frac{1}{120} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n!}\label{eq-8-3-e-n}
\end{equation}
for increasing values of \(n\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7738}{}%
We can use summation notation as a shorthand\footnote{Note that \(0!\) appears in Equation~\hyperref[eq-8-3-e]{(\ref{eq-8-3-e})}. By definition, \(0! = 1\).\label{fn-76}} for writing the sum in \hyperref[eq-8-3-e-n]{Equation~(\ref{eq-8-3-e-n})} to get%
\begin{equation}
e \approx 1+1+\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{24} + \frac{1}{120} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n!} = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{1}{k!}\text{.}\label{eq-8-3-e}
\end{equation}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7739}{}%
We can calculate this sum using as large an \(n\) as we want, and the larger \(n\) is the more accurate the approximation \hyperref[eq-8-3-e]{(\ref{eq-8-3-e})} is. This suggests that we can write the number \(e\) as the infinite sum%
\begin{equation}
e = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k!}\text{.}\label{eq-8-3-e-infinite}

This sum is an example of an \emph{infinite series}. \index{infinite series} Note that the series~\hyperref[eq-8-3-e-infinite]{(\ref{eq-8-3-e-infinite})} is the sum of the terms of the infinite sequence \(\left\{\frac{1}{n!}\right\}\). In general, we use the following notation and terminology.%
\begin{assemblage}[Infinite Series]\label{assemblage-159}
\hypertarget{p-7741}{}%
An \terminology{infinite series} of real numbers is the sum of the entries in an infinite sequence of real numbers. In other words, an infinite series is sum of the form%
\begin{equation*}
a_1+a_2+ \cdots + a_n + \cdots = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k\text{,}
\end{equation*}
where \(a_1\), \(a_2\), \(\ldots\), are real numbers.%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-7742}{}%
We use summation notation to identify a series. If the series adds the entries of a sequence \(\{a_n\}_{n \geq 1}\), we will write the series as%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k \geq 1} a_k
\end{equation*}
or%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k\text{.}

Is it even possible to sum an infinite list of numbers? That doing so is possible in some situations shouldn't come as a surprise. The definite integral is the sum of an infinite collections of numbers, and we have already examined the special case of geometric series in the previous section. As we investigate other infinite sums, there are two key questions we seek to answer: (1) is the sum finite? and (2) if yes, what is its value?%

These sums in the table in part (c) seem to indicate that the sequence \(\{S_n\}\) converges to something a bit larger than 1.5. Since the sequence \(\{S_n\}\) is found by adding up the first \(k\) terms of the series, we should expect that the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k^2}\) is the limit of the sequence \(\{S_n\}\) as \(n\) goes to infinity.%

The example in \hyperref[act-8-3-1]{Example~\ref{act-8-3-1}} illustrates how we define the sum of an infinite series. We construct a new sequence of numbers (called the \emph{sequence of partial sums}) \index{partial sum} \index{sequence of partial sums} where the \(n\)th term in the sequence consists of the sum of the first \(n\) terms of the series. If this sequence converges, the corresponding infinite series is said to converge, and we say that we can find the sum of the series. More formally, we have the following definition.%
\begin{assemblage}[Partial Sum]\label{assemblage-160}
\hypertarget{p-7768}{}%
The \terminology{\(n\)th partial sum} of the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k\) is the finite sum \(S_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7769}{}%
In other words, the \(n\)th partial sum \(S_n\) of a series is the sum of the first \(n\) terms in the series,%
\begin{equation*}
S_n = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-7770}{}%
We investigate the behavior of the series by examining the sequence%
\begin{equation*}
S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_n, \ldots
\end{equation*}
of its partial sums. If the sequence of partial sums converges to some finite number, we say that the corresponding series \emph{converges}. \index{series!converges} Otherwise, we say the series \emph{diverges}. \index{series!diverges} From our work in \hyperref[act-8-3-1]{Example~\ref{act-8-3-1}}, the series%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^2}
\end{equation*}
appears to converge to some number near 1.54977. We formalize the concept of convergence and divergence of an infinite series in the following definition.%
\begin{assemblage}[Convergent Series and Divergent Series]\label{assemblage-161}
\hypertarget{p-7771}{}%
The infinite series%

\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7773}{}%
If \(\lim_{n \to \infty} S_n = S\), then we call \(S\) the sum of the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k\). That is,%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k = \lim_{n \to \infty} S_n = S\text{.}

The early terms in a series do not influence whether or not the series converges or diverges. Rather, the convergence or divergence of a series%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k
\end{equation*}
is determined by what happens to the terms \(a_k\) for very large values of \(k\). To see why, suppose that \(m\) is some constant larger than 1. Then%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k = (a_1+a_2+ \cdots + a_m) + \sum_{k=m+1}^{\infty} a_k\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7777}{}%
Since \(a_1+a_2+ \cdots + a_m\) is a finite number, the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k\) will converge if and only if the series \(\sum_{k=m+1}^{\infty} a_k\) converges. Because the starting index of the series doesn't affect whether the series converges or diverges, we will often just write%
\begin{equation*}
\sum a_k
\end{equation*}
when we are interested in questions of convergence/divergence as opposed to the exact sum of a series.%

In \hyperref[sec-7-2-geometric]{Section~\ref{sec-7-2-geometric}} we encountered the special family of infinite geometric series. Recall that a geometric series has the form \(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} ar^k\), where \(a\) and \(r\) are real numbers (and \(r \ne 1\)). We found that the \(n\)th partial sum \(S_n\) of a geometric series is given by the convenient formula%
\begin{equation*}
S_n = \frac{1-r^{n}}{1-r}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and thus a geometric series converges if \(|r| \lt  1\). Geometric series diverge for all other values of \(r\).%

This information alone doesn't seem to be enough to tell us if the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k}\) converges or diverges. The partial sums could eventually level off to some fixed number or continue to grow without bound. Even if we look at larger partial sums, such as \(\sum_{n=1}^{1000} \frac{1}{k} \approx 7.485470861\), the result isn't particularly convincing one way or another. The Integral Test is one way to determine whether or not the harmonic series converges, and we explore this test further in the next example.%
\begin{example}[]\label{act-8-3-4}
\hypertarget{p-7831}{}%
Consider the harmonic series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k}\). Recall that the harmonic series will converge provided that its sequence of partial sums converges. The \(n\)th partial sum \(S_n\) of the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k}\) is%
\begin{align*}
S_n =\mathstrut \amp  \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k}\\
=\mathstrut \amp  1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n}\\
=\mathstrut \amp  1(1) + (1)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + (1)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) + \cdots + (1)\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)\text{.}
\end{align*}

\par
\hypertarget{p-7832}{}%
Through this last expression for \(S_n\), we can visualize this partial sum as a sum of areas of rectangles with heights \(\frac{1}{m}\) and bases of length 1, as shown in \hyperref[F-8-3-4-Integral-Test]{Figure~\ref{F-8-3-4-Integral-Test}}, which uses the 9th partial sum.%

Notice that the \(n\)th partial sum of the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k}\) is equal to the left hand Riemann sum of \(f(x)\) on the interval \([1,n]\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-5040}{}\hypertarget{p-7846}{}%
Since \(f\) is a decreasing function, it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} \gt \int_{1}^{n} \frac{1}{x} \ dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-5041}{}\hypertarget{p-7847}{}%
Since \(f\) is decreasing, the improper integral \(\int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x} \ dx\) is smaller than the limit of the Riemann sums as \(n\) goes to infinity. So  we wind up with a comparison between the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}\) and the improper integral:%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k} \gt \int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x} \ dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-5042}{}\hypertarget{p-7848}{}%
We can evaluate the improper integral as follows:%
\begin{align*}
\int_{1}^{\infty} f(x) \ dx \amp = \lim_{t \to \infty} \int_{1}^{t} \frac{1}{x} \ dx\\
\amp = \lim_{t \to \infty} \ln(x) |_{1}^{t}\\
\amp = \lim_{t \to \infty} \left(\ln(t) - \ln(1) \right)\\
\amp = \infty\text{.}
\end{align*}
Since the value of the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k}\) exceeds the value of the infinite improper integral, we must conclude that the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k}\) diverges.%

The ideas from \hyperref[act-8-3-4]{Example~\ref{act-8-3-4}} hold more generally. Suppose that \(f\) is a continuous decreasing function and that \(a_k = f(k)\) for each value of \(k\). Consider the corresponding series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k\). The partial sum%
\begin{equation*}
S_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k
\end{equation*}
can always be viewed as a left hand Riemann sum of \(f(x)\), using rectangles with bases of width 1 and heights given by the values \(a_k\). A representative picture is shown at left in \hyperref[F-8-3-Integral-Test]{Figure~\ref{F-8-3-Integral-Test}}. Since \(f\) is a decreasing function, we have that%
\begin{equation*}
S_n \gt \int_1^n f(x) \ dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7850}{}%
Taking the limit as \(n\) goes to infinity shows that%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k \gt \int_{1}^{\infty} f(x) \ dx\text{.}

\hypertarget{p-7851}{}%
Therefore, if the improper integral \(\int_{1}^{\infty} f(x) \ dx\) diverges, so does the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k\).%

\amp = \lim_{t \to \infty} \left(-\frac{1}{t} + \frac{1}{1} \right)\\

\item\hypertarget{li-5054}{}\hypertarget{p-7871}{}%
Assume \(p \gt 1\). Then \(p-1 \gt 0\) and so \(x^{-p+1} = \frac{1}{x^{p-1}}\) and%

\amp = \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{x^{-p+1}}{-p+1} \biggm|_{1}^{t}\\
\amp = \frac{1}{1-p} \lim_{t \to \infty} \left(t^{-p+1} -  1 \right)\\
\amp = \frac{1}{p-1}\text{.}

So the improper integral \(\int_1^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^p} \ dx\) converges when \(p \gt 1\). The Integral Test then shows that the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^p}\) converges when \(p \gt 1\).%

\int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^p} \ dx \amp = \lim_{t \to \infty} \int_{1}^{t} \frac{1}{x^p} \ dx\\
\amp = \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{x^{-p+1}}{-p+1} \biggm|_{1}^{t}\\
\amp = \frac{1}{1-p} \lim_{t \to \infty} \left(t^{-p+1} -  1 \right)\\
\amp = \infty\text{.}

So the improper integral \(\int_1^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^p} \ dx\) diverges when \(p \lt  1\). The Integral Test then shows that the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^p}\) also diverges when \(p \lt  1\).%

The Integral Test allows us to determine the convergence of an entire family of series: the \(p\)-series. However, we have seen that it is often difficult to integrate functions, so the Integral Test is not one that we can use all of the time. In fact, even for a relatively simple series such as \(\sum \frac{k^2+1}{k^4+2k+2}\), the Integral Test is not an option. In what follows we develop a test that applies to series of rational functions by comparing their behavior to that of other series whose convergence behavior we know.%
\begin{assemblage}[The Direct Comparison Test]\label{assemblage-166}

\end{itemize}
%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-7881}{}%
The idea behind the Direct Comparison Test is very intuitive. If a series \(\sum a_n\) has terms that are all (beyond a certain \(n\)) smaller than the corresponding terms in a series \(\sum b_n\) that we know converges, then the unknown series \(\sum a_n \) must also converge, because it is "smaller" than something finite. Thus, we can use the first bullet point above to prove that a series \(\left( \sum a_n \right)\) converges.%

On the other hand, if a series \(\sum b_n \) has terms that are all (beyond a certain \(n\)) larger than the corresponding terms in a series \(\sum a_n \) that we know diverges, then the series \(\sum b_n \) must also diverge, because it is "larger" than something infinite. Thus, we can use the second bullet point to prove that a series \(\left(\sum b_n \right)\) diverges.%

Consider the series%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n-2}{n^4+1}.
\end{equation*}
Since the convergence or divergence of a series only depends on the behavior of the series for large values of \(n \), we might examine the terms of this series more closely as \(n\) gets large. By computing the value of \(\frac{n-2}{n^4+1} \) for \(n=100 \) and \(n=1000\), explain why the terms \(\frac{n-2}{n^4+1} \) are essentially \(\frac{n}{n^4} \) when \(n\) is large.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5060}{}\hypertarget{p-7885}{}%
This gives us the sense that the series \(\sum \frac{n-2}{n^4+1} \) should behave the same way that \(\sum \frac{n}{n^4} = \sum \frac{1}{n^3}\) behaves. Does \(\sum \frac{1}{n^3} \) converge or diverge? Why?%

Show that for all \(n\geq 2\), \(0 \leq \frac{n-2}{n^4+1} \leq \frac{n}{n^4} = \frac{1}{n^3}.\) You can then use the direct comparison test to argue that%

When \(n\) is very large, the constant 2 in the numerator is negligible when compared to \(n\), and the constant 1 in the denominator is negligible when compared to \(n^4\). So for large \(n\), the numerator looks like \(n\) and the denominator looks like \(n^4\). Thus, the fraction \(\frac{n-2}{n^4+1}\) looks like \(\frac{n}{n^4}\) for large \(n\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-5064}{}\hypertarget{p-7890}{}%
We know that \(\sum \frac{1}{n^3} \) is a \(p\)-series with \(p=3\), so it is a convergent series. Thus, we expect that \(\sum \frac{n-2}{n^4+1} \) will converge too.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5065}{}\hypertarget{p-7891}{}%
Since we expect \(\sum \frac{n-2}{n^4+1}\) to converge, we'll want to use the first bullet point from the test, so we need to complete the inequality%
\begin{equation*}
0 \leq \frac{n-2}{n^4+1} \leq \cdots 
\end{equation*}
until we get to a series we know converges. Since a fraction increases if we make the numerator larger or if we make the denominator smaller, we can do the following:%
\begin{equation*}
0 \leq \frac{n-2}{n^4+1} \leq \frac{n}{n^4+1} \leq \frac{n}{n^4} = \frac{1}{n^3} 
\end{equation*}
for all \(n \geq 1 \). Now since \(\sum \frac{1}{n^3} \) converges, then \(\sum \frac{n-2}{n^4+1} \) also converges by the Direct Comparison Test.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5066}{}\hypertarget{p-7892}{}%
We similarly first get a feel for what we expect the series to do. For very large \(n\), \(\frac{3n+2}{4n^2-3}\) behaves like \(\frac{3n}{4n^2} = \frac{3}{4n} = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{n}\). Since \(\sum \frac{1}{n} \) diverges, then \(\sum \frac{3}{4n} \) also diverges, so we expect \(\sum \frac{3n+2}{4n^2-3} \) to diverge as well.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7893}{}%
Thus, this time we'll use the second bullet point and build the inequality%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{3n+2}{4n^2-3}  \geq \cdots \geq 0 
\end{equation*}
where the middle is filled in with a series whose convergence behavior we know. To make a fraction smaller, we should decrease the numerator and increase the denominator. So we can do%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{3n+2}{4n^2-3} \geq \frac{3n}{4n^2-3} \geq \frac{3n}{4n^2} = \frac{3}{4n} \geq 0. 
\end{equation*}
Now since \(\sum \frac{3}{4n} \) diverges, then \(\sum \frac{3n+2}{4n^2-3}\) also diverges by the Direct Comparison Test.%

\hypertarget{p-7894}{}%
In order to use the direct comparison test, we have to be able to set up the inequalities requried by the test, which can sometimes be difficult. The following example illustrates this.%

For large \(k\), \(\frac{k+1}{k^3+2} \) behaves like \(\frac{k}{k^3} = \frac{1}{k^2}\). Since \(\sum \frac{1}{k^2}\) is a \(p\)-series with \(p=2\), then \(\sum \frac{1}{k^2}\) converges, so we expect \(\frac{k+1}{k^3+2}\) to converge as well.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5070}{}\hypertarget{p-7899}{}%
We need to find a series whose \(k\)th term is larger than \(\frac{k+1}{k^3+2}\). We can begin as in the previous example with:%
\begin{equation*}
0 \leq \frac{k+1}{k^3+2} \leq \frac{k+1}{k^3} 
\end{equation*}
for all \(k \geq 1\). However, \(\frac{k}{k^3}\) is smaller than \(\frac{k+1}{k^3}\), not larger. Thus, we have to make more of an effort to find a useful inequality. For example:%
\begin{equation*}
0 \leq \frac{k+1}{k^3+2} \leq \frac{k+1}{k^3} \leq \frac{k+k}{k^3} = \frac{2k}{k^3} \text{.}
\end{equation*}
This works because in the numerator, \(k+1 \leq k+k\) for \(k\geq 1\). Now \(\frac{2k}{k^3}=2\left(\frac{1}{k^2}\right)\), which yields a convergent \(p\)-series. Therefore, by the direct comparison test, \(\sum\frac{k+1}{k^3+2} \) also converges.%

The limit comparison test is another test that can be used to determine series convergence and works in many of the same situations that the direct comparison test is used. However, the limit comparison test does not require any inequalities between the series you are comparing, so in some cases it can be easier to use than the direct comparison test.%

\amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{1+\frac{1}{k}}{1+\frac{2}{k}}\\

This tells us that \(a_k \approx b_k\) for large values of \(k\), formally (before, we were only building intuition and hadn't proved this).%
\item\hypertarget{li-5076}{}\hypertarget{p-7909}{}%
Since \(\frac{k}{k^3} = \frac{1}{k^2}\), the series \(\sum \frac{k}{k^3}\) is a \(p\)-series with \(p=2\) and so converges. Since \(a_k \approx b_k\) for large values of \(k\), it seems reasonable to expect that \(\sum a_k \approx \sum b_k\). Since \(\sum a_k\) is finite, we should then conclude that \(\sum b_k\) is also finite. So \(\sum \frac{k+1}{k^3+2}\) should be a convergent series.%
\end{enumerate}

\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-7910}{}%
\hyperref[act-8-3-6]{Example~\ref{act-8-3-6}} illustrates how we can compare one series with positive terms to another whose convergence status we know. Suppose we have two series \(\sum a_k\) and \(\sum b_k\) with positive terms and we know the convergence status of the series \(\sum a_k\). Recall that the convergence or divergence of a series depends only on the terms of the series for large values of \(k\), so if we know that \(a_k\) and \(b_k\) are proportional for large \(k\), then the two series \(\sum a_k\) and \(\sum b_k\) should behave the same way. In other words, if there is a positive finite constant \(c\) such that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{b_k}{a_k} = c\text{,}
\end{equation*}
then \(b_k \approx ca_k\) for large values of \(k\). So%
\begin{equation*}
\sum b_k \approx \sum ca_k = c  \sum a_k\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7911}{}%
Since multiplying by a nonzero constant does not affect the convergence or divergence of a series, it follows that the series \(\sum a_k\) and \(\sum b_k\) either both converge or both diverge. The formal statement of this fact is called the Limit Comparison Test.%
\begin{assemblage}[The Limit Comparison Test]\label{assemblage-167}
\hypertarget{p-7912}{}%
Let \(\sum a_k\) and \(\sum b_k\) be series with positive terms. If%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{b_k}{a_k} = c
\end{equation*}
for some positive (finite) constant \(c\), then \(\sum a_k\) and \(\sum b_k\) either both converge or both diverge.%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-7913}{}%
The Limit Comparison Test shows that if we have a series \(\sum \frac{p(k)}{q(k)}\) of rational functions where \(p(k)\) is a polynomial of degree \(m\) and \(q(k)\) a polynomial of degree \(l\), then the series \(\sum \frac{p(k)}{q(k)}\) will behave like the series \(\sum \frac{k^m}{k^l}\). So this test allows us to determine the convergence or divergence of series whose terms are rational functions.%

We know that \(\sum \frac{1}{k^2}\) is a \(p\)-series with \(p > 1\) and so \(\sum \frac{1}{k^2}\) converges. Therefore, the series \(\sum \frac{k^2+1}{k^4+2k+2}\) also converges.%

The Limit Comparison Test works well if we can find a series with known behavior to compare. But such series are not always easy to find. Below, we will examine a test that allows us to consider the behavior of a series by comparing it to a geometric series, without knowing in advance which geometric series we need.%

The calculations in the table in part (a) seem to indicate that the ratio \(\frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k}\) is roughly \(\frac{2}{3}\) when \(k\) is large.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5085}{}\hypertarget{p-7930}{}%
Since \(\frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \approx \frac{2}{3}\) for large \(k\), the series \(\sum \frac{2^k}{3^k-k}\) is approximately the same as \(\sum \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^k\) when \(k\) is large. So the series \(\sum \frac{2^k}{3^k-k}\) is approximately geometric with ratio \(\frac{2}{3}\) when \(k\) is large. Since the series \(\sum \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^k\) converges because the ratio is less than 1, we expect that the series \(\sum \frac{2^k}{3^k-k}\) will also converge.%

We can generalize the argument in \hyperref[act-8-3-8]{Example~\ref{act-8-3-8}} in the following way. Consider the series \(\sum a_k\). If%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \approx r
\end{equation*}
for large values of \(k\), then \(a_{k+1} \approx ra_k\) for large \(k\) and the series \(\sum a_k\) is approximately the geometric series \(\sum ar^k\) for large \(k\). Since the geometric series with ratio \(r\) converges only for \(-1 \lt   r \lt  1\), we see that the series \(\sum a_k\) will converge if%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} = r

for a value of \(r\) such that \(|r| \lt  1\). This result is known as the Ratio Test.%

\emph{Note well:} The Ratio Test looks at the limit of the ratio of consecutive terms of a given series; in so doing, the test is asking, ``is this series approximately geometric?'' If so, the test uses the limit of the ratio of consecutive terms to determine if the given series converges.%

We have now encountered several tests for determining convergence or divergence of series. \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}The Divergence Test can be used to show that a series diverges, but never to prove that a series converges.%
\item{}We used the Integral Test to determine the convergence status of an entire class of series, the \(p\)-series. More generally, the Integral Test may be applied whenever the series terms correspond to a function that is positive and decreasing and whose convergence behavior when integrated is known.%
\item{}The Direct Comparison Test and Limit Comparison Test work well for series that involve rational functions and which can therefore be compared to \(p\)-series and other series whose convergence behavior we know.%
\item{}Finally, the Ratio Test allows us to compare our series to a geometric series; it is particularly useful for series that involve \(n\)th powers and factorials.%
\item{}Another test, called the Root Test, is discussed in the exercises.%

Since \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n}{2^n} = 0\), the Divergence Test does not apply. The Ratio Test is a good one to apply with series whose terms involve exponentials and polynomials.%

In this example we have \(a_{n+1} = \frac{n+1}{2^{n+1}}\) and \(a_n = \frac{n}{2^n}\). So%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = \frac{\frac{n+1}{2^{n+1}}}{\frac{n}{2^n}} = \frac{n+1}{2n}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
As \(n\) goes to infinity, the fraction \(\frac{n+1}{n}\) goes to 1 and so%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n+1}{2n} = \frac{1}{2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
So in this example, for large \(n\) we have that \(\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \approx \frac{1}{2}\) or that \(\sum a_n\) is roughly a geometric series for large \(n\) with ratio \(\frac{1}{2}\). Since geometric series with ratio \(\frac{1}{2}\) converges, we can conclude that%

\sum \frac{n}{2^n}

\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{ \frac{10^{k+1}}{(k+1)!} }{ \frac{10^k}{k!} }\\
\amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{10^{k+1}(k!)}{10^k(k+1)!}\\
\amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{10}{k+1}\\
\amp = 0\text{,}
\end{align*}
so the Ratio Test shows that \(\sum \frac{10^k}{k!}\) converges.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5105}{}\hypertarget{p-7953}{}%
If we ignore the highest powered terms, then the series \(\sum \frac{k^3-2k^2+1}{k^6+4}\) looks like the series \(\sum \frac{k^3}{k^6} = \sum \frac{1}{k^3}\). We formally apply the Limit Comparison Test as follows:%
\begin{align*}
\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{ \frac{k^3-2k^2+1}{k^6+4} }{  \frac{1}{k^3} } \amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{k^6-2k^5+k^3}{k^6+4}\\
\amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{1 - \frac{2}{k} + \frac{1}{k^3}}{1 + \frac{4}{k^6}}\\
\amp  1\text{.}
\end{align*}
Since \(\sum \frac{1}{k^3}\) is a \(p\)-series with \(p=3 \gt 1\), the series \(\sum \frac{1}{k^3}\) converges. Consequently, the Limit Comparison Test shows that \(\sum \frac{k^3-2k^2+1}{k^6+4}\) converges as well.%

An infinite series is a sum of the elements in an infinite sequence. In other words, an infinite series is a sum of the form%
\begin{equation*}
a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n + \cdots = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k
\end{equation*}
where \(a_k\) is a real number for each positive integer \(k\).%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-7956}{}%
The \(n\)th partial sum \(S_n\) of the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k\) is the sum of the first \(n\) terms of the series. That is,%
\begin{equation*}
S_n = a_1+a_2+ \cdots + a_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-7957}{}%
The sequence \(\{S_n\}\) of partial sums of a series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k\) tells us about the convergence or divergence of the series. In particular %
\begin{itemize}[label=$\circ$]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-7958}{}%
The series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k\) converges if the sequence \(\{S_n\}\) of partial sums converges. In this case we say that the series is the limit of the sequence of partial sums and write%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k =\lim_{n \to \infty} S_n\text{.}

Since \(\sqrt[n]{a_n} \approx r\) for large \(n\), it follows \(a_n \approx r^n\) for large \(n\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-5127}{}\hypertarget{p-7986}{}%
Because \(a_n \approx r^n\) for large \(n\), this means that the series \(\sum a_n\) acts like the series \(\sum r^n\) for sufficiently large \(n\). The latter is a geometric series with ratio \(r\) between successive terms. Said differently, \(\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \approx \frac{r^{n+1}}{r^n} = r\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-5128}{}\hypertarget{p-7987}{}%
Since the terms in our series are all positive, we must have \(r \gt 0\). Now the geometric series with ratio \(r\) converges only for \(r \lt  1\),so the series%

\sum a_k

Let \(A_n\) and \(B_n\) be the \(n\)th partial sums of the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k\) and \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} b_k\), respectively. By definition,%
\begin{equation*}
A_n + B_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k + \sum_{k=1}^{n} b_k\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Expanding these finite sums, we have%
\begin{equation*}
A_n + B_n = (a_1 + a_2 + \cdots a_n) + (b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_n)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
By the associative and commutative properties of finite sums, we can rearrange these sums in any order we wish, and also group the terms in any pairings we wish. Thus,%
\begin{equation*}
A_n + B_n = (a_1 + b_1) + (a_2 + b_2) + \cdots + (a_n + b_n)\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and therefore%
\begin{equation*}
A_n + B_n = \sum_{k=1}^n (a_k+b_k)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-5151}{}\hypertarget{p-8014}{}%
The last equality we demonstrated above tells us that%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=1}^n (a_k+b_k) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k + \sum_{k=1}^{n} b_k\text{.}
\end{equation*}
In this equality, we can take the limit of both sides as \(n \to \infty\). On the right side, we know that both \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k\) and \(\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n} b_k\) exist because the two series converge, and therefore the limit of the sum is the sum of the limits. Hence,%
\begin{align*}
\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=1}^n (a_k+b_k) &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left( \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k + \sum_{k=1}^{n} b_k \right)\\
&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k + \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k=1}^{n} b_k\text{.}
\end{align*}
Thus we have shown that%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (a_k+b_k) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} a_k + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} b_k\text{.}

Since both \(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \left( \frac{2}{5} \right)^k\) and \(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \left( \frac{3}{5} \right)^k\) are convergent geometric series, we can apply the result from the last exercise above to say that%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{2^k+3^k}{5^k} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \left( \frac{2}{5} \right)^k + \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \left( \frac{3}{5} \right)^k\text{.}

Applying the known sum of geometric series to each sum on the right, we then have%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{2^k+3^k}{5^k} = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{2}{5}} + \frac{1}{1 - \frac{3}{5}} = \frac{5}{3} + \frac{5}{2} = \frac{25}{6}\text{.}

Since \(a_2 = \frac{1}{4}\) and \(b_2 = \frac{1}{6}\), it is the case that \(a_2 \gt b_2\). We already know that \(S_1 \gt T_1\), so adding a larger number to \(S_1\) than we add to \(T_1\) makes \(S_2 \gt T_2\).%

Since \(a_3 = \frac{1}{9}\) and \(b_3 = \frac{1}{12}\), it is the case that \(a_3 \gt b_3\). We already know that \(S_2 \gt T_2\), so adding a larger number to \(S_2\) than we add to \(T_2\) makes \(S_3 \gt T_3\).%

Since \(n^2+n \gt n^2\) when \(n\) is positive, we have \(\frac{1}{n^2} \gt \frac{1}{n^2+n}\) or \(a_n \gt b_n\). So at each step, we are adding larger numbers to the partial sums of \(\sum \frac{1}{k^2}\) than we are to the partial sums of \(\sum \frac{1}{k^2+k}\), we conclude that \(S_n \gt T_n\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-5173}{}\hypertarget{p-8042}{}%
Since \(S_n \gt T_n\), we should expect \(\lim_{n \to \infty} S_n \gt \lim_{n \to \infty} T_n\) or%

Since \(\sum \frac{1}{k^2}\) is a \(p\)-series with \(p=2 \gt 1\), we know that \(\sum \frac{1}{k^2}\) converges (and is finite). Now \(\sum \frac{1}{k^2+k}\) is a sum of positive terms and is therefore positive, and is also less than a finite number (\(\sum \frac{1}{k^2}\)), so we expect that \(\sum \frac{1}{k^2+k}\) converges as well.%

If we have two series \(\sum a_k\) and \(\sum b_k\) of positive terms with \(a_k \geq b_k\) for every \(k\), then%
\begin{equation*}
\sum a_k \geq \sum b_k \gt 0\text{.}

Now if \(\sum b_k\) diverges, then \(\sum b_k\) is infinite. Anything larger must also be infinite and so \(\sum a_k\) must also diverge.

For any \(k\) we have \(k \gt k-1\), so if \(k \gt 1\) then it follows that \(0 \lt \frac{1}{k} \lt \frac{1}{k-1}\). Since the harmonic series \(\sum \frac{1}{k}\) diverges, the Direct Comparison Test shows that the larger series \(\sum \frac{1}{k-1}\) must also diverge.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5176}{}\hypertarget{p-8048}{}%
In this case we know that \(k^3 \lt  k^3+1\) and so if \(k \gt 0\) then \(\frac{1}{k^3} \gt \frac{1}{k^3+1}\). It follows that \(\frac{k}{k^3} \gt \frac{k}{k^3+1}\) and so the series \(\sum \frac{k}{k^3+1}\) is bounded below by 0 and above by the series \(\sum \frac{k}{k^3}\). Now%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{k}{k^3} = \frac{1}{k^2}
\end{equation*}
and so the series \(\sum \frac{k}{k^3}\) is a \(p\)-series with \(p=2\) and converges. The Direct Comparison Test shows that the smaller series \(\sum \frac{k}{k^3+1}\) must also converge.%

\hypertarget{p-8053}{}%
So far, we've mostly considered series with exclusively nonnegative terms. Next, we consider series that have some negative terms. For instance, the geometric series%
\begin{equation*}
2 - \frac{4}{3} + \frac{8}{9} - \cdots + 2 \left(-\frac{2}{3} \right)^n + \cdots\text{,}
\end{equation*}
has \(a = 2\) and \(r = -\frac{2}{3}\), so that every other term alternates in sign. This series converges to%
\begin{equation*}
S = \frac{a}{1-r} = \frac{2}{1- \left(-\frac{2}{3}\right)} = \frac{6}{5}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8054}{}%
In \hyperref[PA-8-4]{Example~\ref{PA-8-4}} and our following discussion, we investigate the behavior of similar series where consecutive terms have opposite signs.%
\begin{example}[]\label{PA-8-4}
\hypertarget{p-8055}{}%
\hyperref[PA-8-3]{Example~\ref{PA-8-3}} showed how we can approximate the number \(e\) with linear, quadratic, and other polynomial approximations. We use a similar approach in this example to obtain linear and quadratic approximations to \(\ln(2)\). Along the way, we encounter a type of series that is different than most of the ones we have seen so far. Throughout this example, let \(f(x) = \ln(1+x)\).%

\item\hypertarget{li-5181}{}\hypertarget{p-8057}{}%
Find the tangent line to \(f\) at \(x=0\) and use this linearization to approximate \(\ln(2)\). That is, find \(L(x)\), the tangent line approximation to \(f(x)\), and use the fact that \(L(1) \approx f(1)\) to estimate \(\ln(2)\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-5182}{}\hypertarget{p-8058}{}%
The linearization of \(\ln(1+x)\) does not provide a very good approximation to \(\ln(2)\) since \(1\) is not that close to \(0\). To obtain a better approximation, we alter our approach; instead of using a straight line to approximate \(\ln(2)\), we use a quadratic function to account for the concavity of \(\ln(1+x)\) for \(x\) close to \(0\). With the linearization, both the function's value and slope agree with the linearization's value and slope at \(x=0\). We will now make a quadratic approximation \(P_2(x)\) to \(f(x) = \ln(1+x)\) centered at \(x=0\) with the property that \(P_2(0) = f(0)\), \(P'_2(0) = f'(0)\), and \(P''_2(0) = f''(0)\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8059}{}%
%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-5183}{}\hypertarget{p-8060}{}%
Let \(P_2(x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2}\). Show that \(P_2(0) = f(0)\), \(P'_2(0) = f'(0)\), and \(P''_2(0) = f''(0)\). Use \(P_2(x)\) to approximate \(\ln(2)\) by using the fact that \(P_2(1) \approx f(1)\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-5184}{}\hypertarget{p-8061}{}%
We can continue approximating \(\ln(2)\) with polynomials of larger degree whose derivatives agree with those of \(f\) at \(0\). This makes the polynomials fit the graph of \(f\) better for more values of \(x\) around \(0\). For example, let \(P_3(x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^3}{3}\). Show that \(P_3(0) = f(0)\), \(P'_3(0) = f'(0)\), \(P''_3(0) = f''(0)\), and \(P'''_3(0) = f'''(0)\). Taking a similar approach to preceding questions, use \(P_3(x)\) to approximate \(\ln(2)\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-5185}{}\hypertarget{p-8062}{}%
If we used a degree \(4\) or degree \(5\) polynomial to approximate \(\ln(1+x)\), what approximations of \(\ln(2)\) do you think would result? Use the preceding questions to conjecture a pattern that holds, and state the degree \(4\) and degree \(5\) approximation.%

\hyperref[PA-8-4]{Example~\ref{PA-8-4}} gives us several approximations to \(\ln(2)\). The linear approximation is \(1\), and the quadratic approximation is \(1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}\). If we continue this process, cubic, quartic (degree \(4\)), quintic (degree \(5\)), and higher degree polynomials give us the approximations to \(\ln(2)\) in \hyperref[T-8-4-ln2]{Table~\ref{T-8-4-ln2}}.%

The pattern here shows that \(\ln(2)\) can be approximated by the partial sums of the infinite series%
\begin{equation}
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k+1} \frac{1}{k}\label{eq-ln-2}
\end{equation}
where the alternating signs are indicated by the factor \((-1)^{k+1}\). We call such a series an \emph{alternating series}. \index{alternating series}%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8073}{}%
Using computational technology, we find that the sum of the first 100 terms in this series is 0.6881721793. As a comparison, \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931471806\). This shows that even though the series~\hyperref[eq-ln-2]{(\ref{eq-ln-2})} converges to \(\ln(2)\), it must do so quite slowly, since the sum of the first 100 terms isn't particularly close to \(\ln(2)\). We will investigate the issue of how quickly an alternating series converges later in this section.%
\begin{assemblage}[Alternating Series]\label{assemblage-169}
\hypertarget{p-8074}{}%
An \terminology{alternating series}  is a series of the form%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^k a_k\text{,}
\end{equation*}
where \(a_k \gt 0\) for each \(k\).%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-8075}{}%
We have some flexibility in how we write an alternating series; for example, the series%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k+1} a_k\text{,}
\end{equation*}
whose index starts at \(k = 1\), is also alternating. As we will soon see, there are several very nice results that hold for alternating series, while alternating series can also demonstrate some unusual behaivior.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8076}{}%
It is important to remember that most of the series tests we have seen in previous sections apply only to series with nonnegative terms. Alternating series require a different test.%
\begin{example}[]\label{act-8-4-1}

Since \((k+1)^2 + 2 \gt k^2+2\) it follows that \(\frac{1}{(k+1)^2+2} \lt \frac{1}{k^2+2}\) and the sequence \(\frac{1}{k^2+2}\) decreases to 0. The Alternating Series Test shows then that the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^k}{k^2+2}\) converges.%

In this case we have that \(\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{2k}{k+5} = 2\) and so the sequence of \(k\)th terms does not even converge to 0. So the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{2(-1)^{k+1}k}{k+5}\) diverges by the Divergence Test.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5208}{}\hypertarget{p-8112}{}%
We know that the natural log is an increasing function, so \(\frac{1}{\ln(k)}\) is a decreasing function. It is also true that \(\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{1}{\ln(k)} = 0\) and so the series \(\sum_{k=2}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k}}{\ln(k)}\) converges by the Alternating Series Test.%

\hypertarget{p-8113}{}%
If the series converges, the argument for the Alternating Series Test also provides us with a method to determine how close the \(n\)th partial sum \(S_n\) is to the actual sum of the series. To see how this works, let \(S\) be the sum of a convergent alternating series, so%
\begin{equation*}
S = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^k a_k\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8114}{}%
Recall that the sequence of partial sums oscillates around the sum \(S\) so that%
\begin{equation*}
\left|S - S_n \right| \lt  \left| S_{n+1} - S_n \right| = a_{n+1}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8115}{}%
Therefore, the value of the term \(a_{n+1}\) provides an error estimate for how well the partial sum \(S_n\) approximates the actual sum \(S\). We summarize this fact in the statement of the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem. \index{alternating series estimation theorem}%
\begin{assemblage}[Alternating Series Estimation Theorem]\label{assemblage-171}
\hypertarget{p-8116}{}%
If the alternating series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k+1}a_k\) converges and has sum \(S\), and \(S_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} (-1)^{k+1}a_k\) is the \(n\)th partial sum of the alternating series, then%
\begin{equation*}
\left\lvert \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k+1}a_k - S_n \right\rvert \leq a_{n+1}\text{.}

\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-434}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-8118}{}%
If we let \(S\) be the sum of the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k}\), then we know that%
\begin{equation*}
\left| S_{100} - S \right| \lt  a_{101}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8119}{}%
Now%
\begin{equation*}
a_{101} = \frac{1}{101} \approx 0.0099\text{,}
\end{equation*}
so the 100th partial sum is within 0.0099 of the sum of the series. We have discussed the fact (and will later verify) that%
\begin{equation*}
S = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k} = \ln(2)\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and so \(S \approx 0.693147\) while%
\begin{equation*}
S_{100} = \sum_{k=1}^{100} \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k} \approx 0.6881721793\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8120}{}%

\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-435}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-8123}{}%
First note that the sequence \(\left\{\frac{1}{k^4}\right\}\) decreases to 0, so the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k^4}\) converges by the Alternating Series Test. Let \(S\) be the sum \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k^4}\) and \(S_n\) the \(n\)th partial sum of the series. We know that%
\begin{equation*}
|S - S_n| \lt  a_{n+1} = \frac{1}{(n+1)^4}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8124}{}%
So we only need to determine the value of \(n\) so that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{(n+1)^4} \lt  0.0001\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8125}{}%
This happens when \((n+1)^4 \lt 10000\) or when \(n+1 \gt 10\). So \(n = 10\) will do. A computer algebra system gives \(S_{10} \approx 0.9469925924\) while \(\frac{7}{720} \pi^4 \approx 0.9470328299\). These do agree to \(0.0001\).%

Also, \(\frac{d}{dk} \frac{\ln(k)}{k} = \frac{1-\ln(k)}{k^2}\) is negative when \(k \gt e\), so the sequence \(\left\{ \frac{\ln(k)}{k} \right\}\) ultimately decreases to 0. Since the first few terms in a series are irrelevant to its convergence or divergence, we conclude that the series \(\sum (-1)^k \frac{\ln(k)}{k}\) converges by the Alternating Series test.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5233}{}\hypertarget{p-8162}{}%
Note that%
\begin{align*}
\lim_{t \to \infty} \int_{1}^{t} \frac{\ln(x)}{x} \amp = \lim_{t \to \infty} \left. \frac{\ln(x)^2}{2} \right|_1^t\\
\amp = \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{\ln(t)^2}{2}\\
\amp = \lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{\ln(t)^2}{2}\\
\amp = \infty\text{.}
\end{align*}
Since the improper integral diverges, the Integral Test shows that the series \(\sum (-1)^k \frac{\ln(k)}{k}\) diverges. So the series \(\sum (-1)^k \frac{\ln(k)}{k}\) converges conditionally.%

\item\hypertarget{li-5234}{}\hypertarget{p-8164}{}%
By L'Hopital's Rule we have%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{\ln(k)}{k^2} = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{1}{2k^2} = 0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Also,%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dk} \frac{\ln(k)}{k^2} = \frac{k-2k\ln(k)}{k^4} = \frac{1-2\ln(k)}{k^3}
\end{equation*}
is negative when \(k \gt e\), so the sequence \(\left\{ \frac{\ln(k)}{k^2} \right\}\) ultimately decreases to 0. Since the first few terms in a series are irrelevant to its convergence or divergence, we conclude that the series \(\sum (-1)^k \frac{\ln(k)}{k^2}\) converges by the Alternating Series test.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5235}{}\hypertarget{p-8165}{}%
Notice that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{ \ln(k) }{ k^{1/2} } = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{2}{k^{1/2}} = 0\text{,}
\end{equation*}
So \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\) dominates \(\ln(k)\) and \(\ln(k) \lt \sqrt{k}\) for large \(k\). It follows that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\ln(k)}{k^2} \lt  \frac{ \sqrt{k} }{k^2} = \frac{1}{k^{3/2}}
\end{equation*}
for large \(k\). Therefore,%
\begin{equation*}
\sum \frac{\ln(k)}{k^2} \lt  \sum \frac{1}{k^{3/2}}
\end{equation*}
for large \(k\). Since \(\sum \frac{1}{k^{3/2}}\) is a \(p\)-series with \(p=\frac{3}{2} \gt 1\), the series \(\sum \frac{1}{k^{3/2}}\) converges. This forces the series \(\sum \frac{\ln(k)}{k^2}\) to converge as well, by the direct comparison test. So \(\sum (-1)^k \frac{\ln(k)}{k^2}\) converges absolutely.%

Conditionally convergent series turn out to be very interesting. If the sequence \(\{a_n\}\) decreases to 0, but the series \(\sum a_k\) diverges, the conditionally convergent series \(\sum (-1)^k a_k\) is right on the borderline of being a divergent series. As a result, any conditionally convergent series converges very slowly. Furthermore, some very strange things can happen with conditionally convergent series, as illustrated in some of the exercises.%

We close this section of the text with a summary of all the tests we have encountered, followed by an example that challenges you to decide which convergence test to apply to several different series.%

\item[{Geometric Series}]\hypertarget{li-5236}{}\hypertarget{p-8169}{}%
The geometric series \(\sum ar^k\) with ratio \(r\) converges for \(-1 \lt r \lt 1\) and diverges for \(|r| \geq 1\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8170}{}%
The sum of the convergent geometric series \(\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} ar^k\) is \(\frac{a}{1-r}\).%
\item[{Divergence Test}]\hypertarget{li-5237}{}\hypertarget{p-8171}{}%
If the sequence \(a_n\) does not converge to 0, then the series \(\sum a_k\) diverges.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8172}{}%
This is the first test to apply because the conclusion is simple. However, if \(\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 0\), no conclusion can be drawn.%
\item[{Integral Test}]\hypertarget{li-5238}{}\hypertarget{p-8173}{}%
Let \(f\) be a positive, decreasing function on an interval \([c,\infty)\) and let \(a_k = f(k)\) for each positive integer \(k \geq c\). %
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-8174}{}%
If \(\int_c^{\infty} f(t) \ dt\) converges, then \(\sum a_k\) converges.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-8175}{}%
If \(\int_c^{\infty} f(t) \ dt\) diverges, then \(\sum a_k\) diverges.%
\end{itemize}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8176}{}%
Use this test when \(f(x)\) is easy to integrate.%
\item[{Direct Comp. Test}]\hypertarget{li-5241}{}\hypertarget{p-8177}{}%

Let \(0 \leq a_k \leq b_k\) for each positive integer \(k\). %
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]

If \(\sum b_k\) converges, then \(\sum a_k\) converges.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-8180}{}%
If \(\sum a_k\) diverges, then \(\sum b_k\) diverges.%
\end{itemize}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8181}{}%
Use this test when you have a series with known behavior that you can compare to \textemdash{} this test can be difficult to apply.%
\item[{Limit Comp. Test}]\hypertarget{li-5244}{}\hypertarget{p-8182}{}%
Let \(a_n\) and \(b_n\) be sequences of positive terms. If%
\begin{equation*}
\displaystyle \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{a_k}{b_k} = L
\end{equation*}
for some positive finite number \(L\), then the two series \(\sum a_k\) and \(\sum b_k\) either both converge or both diverge.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8183}{}%
Easier to apply in general than the comparison test, but you must have a series with known behavior to compare. Useful to apply to series of rational functions.%
\item[{Ratio Test}]\hypertarget{li-5245}{}\hypertarget{p-8184}{}%
Let \(a_k \neq 0\) for each \(k\) and suppose%
\begin{equation*}
\displaystyle \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{|a_{k+1}|}{|a_k|} = r\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-8185}{}%
If \(r \lt 1\), then the series \(\sum a_k\) converges absolutely.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-8186}{}%
If \(r \gt 1\), then the series \(\sum a_k\) diverges.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-8187}{}%
If \(r=1\), then test is inconclusive.%
\end{itemize}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8188}{}%
This test is useful when a series involves factorials and powers.%
\item[{Root Test}]\hypertarget{li-5249}{}\hypertarget{p-8189}{}%
(see Exercise 2 in \hyperref[sec-7-3-series]{Section~\ref{sec-7-3-series}})%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8190}{}%
Let \(a_k \geq 0\) for each \(k\) and suppose%
\begin{equation*}
\displaystyle \lim_{k \to \infty} \sqrt[k]{a_k} = r\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-8191}{}%
If \(r \lt 1\), then the series \(\sum a_k\) converges.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-8192}{}%
If \(r \gt 1\), then the series \(\sum a_k\) diverges.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-8193}{}%
If \(r=1\), then test is inconclusive.%
\end{itemize}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8194}{}%
In general, the Ratio Test can usually be used in place of the Root Test. However, the Root Test can be quick to use when \(a_k\) involves \(k\)th powers.%
\item[{Alt. Series Test}]\hypertarget{li-5253}{}\hypertarget{p-8195}{}%
If \(a_n\) is a positive, decreasing sequence so that \(\displaystyle \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 0\), then the alternating series \(\sum (-1)^{k+1} a_k\) converges.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8196}{}%
This test applies only to alternating series \textemdash{} we assume that the terms \(a_n\) are all positive and that the sequence \(\{a_n\}\) is decreasing.%
\item[{Alt. Series Est.}]\hypertarget{li-5254}{}\hypertarget{p-8197}{}%
Let \(S_n = \displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k+1} a_k\) be the \(n\)th partial sum of the alternating series \(\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k+1} a_k\). Assume \(a_n \gt 0\) for each positive integer \(n\), the sequence \(a_n\) decreases to 0 and \(\displaystyle \lim_{n \to \infty} S_n = S\). Then it follows that \(|S - S_n| \lt a_{n+1}\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8198}{}%
This bound can be used to determine the accuracy of the partial sum \(S_n\) as an approximation of the sum of a convergent alternating series.%

\item\hypertarget{li-5277}{}\hypertarget{p-8225}{}%
For large values of \(k\), \(\frac{2}{\sqrt{k-2}}\) looks like \(\frac{2}{\sqrt{k}}\). We will use the Limit Comparison Test to compare these two series:%
\begin{align*}
\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{\frac{2}{\sqrt{k-2}}}{\frac{2}{\sqrt{k}}} \amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{\sqrt{k}}{\sqrt{k-2}}\\
\amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \sqrt{\frac{1}{1-\frac{2}{k}}}\\
\amp = 1\text{.}
\end{align*}
Since this limit is a positive constant, we know that the two series \(\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} \ \frac{2}{\sqrt{k-2}}\) and \(\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} \ \frac{2}{\sqrt{k}}\) either both converge or both diverge. Now \(\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} \ \frac{2}{\sqrt{k}} = 2\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} \ \frac{1}{k^{1/2}}\) is constant times a \(p\)-series with \(p=\frac{1}{2}\), so \(\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} \ \frac{2}{\sqrt{k}}\) diverges. Therefore, \(\sum_{k=3}^{\infty} \ \frac{2}{\sqrt{k-2}}\) diverges as well.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5278}{}\hypertarget{p-8226}{}%
Note that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{k}{1+2k} = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{k}{2k} = \frac{1}{2}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
so the Divergence Test shows that \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \ \frac{k}{1+2k}\) diverges.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5279}{}\hypertarget{p-8227}{}%
For large values of \(k\), \(\frac{2k^2+1}{k^3+k+1}\) looks like \(\frac{2}{k}\). We will use the Limit Comparison Test to compare these two series:%
\begin{align*}
\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{\frac{2k^2+1}{k^3+k+1}}{\frac{2}{k}} \amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{(2k^2+1)k}{2(k^3+k+1)}\\
\amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{2 + \frac{1}{k^2}}{2+\frac{1}{k^2}+\frac{1}{k^3}}\\
\amp = 1\text{.}
\end{align*}
Since this limit is a positive constant, we know that the two series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \ \frac{2k^2+1}{k^3+k+1}\) and \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \ \frac{2}{k}\) either both converge or both diverge. Now \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \ \frac{2}{k} = 2\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \ \frac{1}{k}\) is constant times a \(p\)-series with \(p=1\), so \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \ \frac{2}{k}\) diverges. Therefore, \(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \ \frac{2k^2+1}{k^3+k+1}\) diverges as well.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5280}{}\hypertarget{p-8228}{}%
Series that involve factorials are good candidates for the Ratio Test:%
\begin{align*}
\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{\frac{100^{k+1}}{(k+1)!}}{\frac{100^k}{k!}} \amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{100^{k+1}k!}{100^k(k+1)!}\\
\amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{100}{k+1}\\
\amp = 0\text{.}
\end{align*}
Since this limit is 0, the Ratio Test tells us that the series \(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \ \frac{100^k}{k!}\) converges.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5281}{}\hypertarget{p-8229}{}%
Notice that \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \ \frac{2^k}{5^k} = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \ \left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^k\) is a geometric series with ratio \(\frac{2}{5}\). Let's write out the first few terms to identify the value of \(a\):%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \ \left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^k = \frac{2}{5} + \left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^3 + \cdots = \left(\frac{2}{5}\right)\left[ 1 + \frac{2}{5} + \left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^2 + \cdots \right]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
So \(a = \frac{2}{5}\). Since the ratio of this geometric series is between \(-1\) and 1, the series converges. The sum of the series is%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \ \frac{2^k}{5^k} = \left(\frac{2}{5}\right) \left(\frac{1}{1-\frac{2}{5}} \right) = \left(\frac{2}{5}\right)\left(\frac{5}{3}\right) = \frac{2}{3}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-5282}{}\hypertarget{p-8230}{}%
For large values of \(n\), \(\frac{k^3-1}{k^5+1}\) looks like \(\frac{k^3}{k^5}=\frac{1}{k^2}\). We will use the Limit Comparison Test to compare \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \ \frac{k^3-1}{k^5+1}\) and \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \ \frac{1}{k^2}\):%
\begin{align*}
\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{\frac{k^3-1}{k^5+1}}{\frac{1}{k^2}} \amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{k^5-k^2}{k^5+1}\\
\amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{1-\frac{1}{k^3}}{1+\frac{1}{k^5}}\\
\amp = 1\text{.}
\end{align*}
Since this limit is 1, we know that the two series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \ \frac{k^3-1}{k^5+1}\) and \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \ \frac{1}{k^2}\) either both converge or both diverge. Now \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \ \frac{1}{k^2}\) is a \(p\)-series with \(p=2\), so \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \ \frac{1}{k^2}\) converges. Therefore, \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \ \frac{k^3-1}{k^5+1}\) converges as well.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5283}{}\hypertarget{p-8231}{}%
This series looks geometric, but to be sure let's write out the first few terms of this series:%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=2}^{\infty} \ \frac{3^{k-1}}{7^k} = \frac{3}{7^2} + \frac{3^2}{7^3} + \frac{3^3}{7^4} + \cdots = \left( \frac{3}{7^2} \right) \left[1 + \frac{3}{7} + \left( \frac{3}{7} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{3}{7} \right)^3 + \cdots \right]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
So \(\sum_{k=2}^{\infty} \ \frac{3^{k-1}}{7^k}\) is a geometric series with \(a = \frac{3}{49}\) and \(r = \frac{3}{7}\). Since the ratio of this geometric series is between \(-1\) and 1, the series converges. The sum of the series is%
\begin{align*}
\sum_{k=2}^{\infty} \ \frac{3^{k-1}}{7^k} \amp = \left(\frac{3}{49}\right) \left(\frac{1}{1-\frac{3}{7}} \right)\\
\amp = \left(\frac{3}{49}\right)\left(\frac{7}{4}\right)\\
\amp = \frac{3}{28}\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-5284}{}\hypertarget{p-8232}{}%
\(\sum_{k=2}^{\infty} \ \frac{1}{k^k}\) converges by direct comparison with the series \(\sum_{k=2}^{\infty} \ \frac{1}{k^2}\). Note that for all \(k\geq 2\), we have \(k^k \geq k^2\), so \(\frac{1}{k^k}\leq \frac{1}{k^2}\). Since \(\sum_{k=2}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}\) is a convergent \(p\)-series with \(p=2\), then by the direct comparison test, \(\sum_{k=2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^k}\) also converges.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5285}{}\hypertarget{p-8233}{}%
This series is an alternating series of the form \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^{k+1} a_k\) with \(a_k = \frac{1}{\sqrt{k+1}}\). Since%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k+1}} = 0
\end{equation*}
and \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k+1}}\) decreases to 0, the Alternating Series Test shows that \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \ \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{\sqrt{k+1}}\) converges.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5286}{}\hypertarget{p-8234}{}%
For this example we will use the Integral Test with the substitution \(w = \ln(x)\), \(dw = \frac{1}{x} \ dx\):%
\begin{align*}
\displaystyle \int_2^{\infty} \frac{1}{x \ln(x)} \ dx \amp = \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_2^b \frac{1}{x \ln(x)} \ dx\\
\amp = \displaystyle \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_{\ln(2)}^{\ln(b)} \frac{1}{w} \ dw\\
\amp = \displaystyle \lim_{b \to \infty} \ln(w) \bigm|_{\ln(2)}^{\ln(b)}\\
\amp = \displaystyle \lim_{b \to \infty} \left[ \ln(\ln(b)) - \ln(\ln(2)) \right]\\
\amp = \infty\text{.}
\end{align*}
Since \(\int_2^{\infty} \frac{1}{x \ln(x)} \ dx\) diverges, we conclude \(\sum_{k=2}^{\infty} \ \frac{1}{k \ln(k)}\) diverges.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5287}{}\hypertarget{p-8235}{}%
First note that the terms \(\frac{1}{\ln(k)}\) decrease to \(0\), so the Alternating Series Test shows that the alternating series \(\sum_{k=2}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^k}{\ln(k)}\) converges. Let \(S = \sum_{k=2}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^k}{\ln(k)}\) and let \(S_n\) be the \(n\)th partial sum of this series. Recall that%
\begin{equation*}
|S_n - S| \lt  |S_n - S_{n+1}| = a_{n+1}
\end{equation*}
where \(a_{n+1} = \frac{1}{\ln(n+1)}\). If we can find a value of \(n\) so that \(a_{n+1} \lt  0.001\), then \(|S_n - S| \lt  0.001\) as desired. Now%
\begin{align*}
a_{n+1} \amp \lt  0.001\\
\frac{1}{\ln(n+1)} \amp \lt  0.001\\
\ln(n+1) \amp \gt 1000\\
n+1 \amp \gt e^{1000}\\
n \amp \gt e^{1000}-1\text{.}
\end{align*}
So if we choose \(n = e^{1000}\), then \(S_n\) approximates the sum of the series to within 0.001. Notice that \(e^{1000} \approx 1.97 \times 10^{434}\) is a very large number. This shows that the series \(\sum_{k=2}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^k}{\ln(k)}\) converges very slowly.%

An alternating series is a series whose terms alternate in sign. It has the form%
\begin{equation*}
\sum (-1)^ka_k
\end{equation*}
where \(a_k\) is a positive real number for each \(k\).%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-8238}{}%
The sequence of partial sums of a convergent alternating series oscillates around the sum of the series if the sequence of \(n\)th terms converges to 0. That is why the Alternating Series Test shows that the alternating series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^ka_k\) converges whenever the sequence \(\{a_n\}\) of \(n\)th terms decreases to 0.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-8239}{}%
The difference between the \((n-1)\)th partial sum \(S_{n-1}\) and the \(n\)th partial sum \(S_n\) of a convergent alternating series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^ka_k\) is \(|S_n - S_{n-1}| = a_n\). Since the partial sums oscillate around the sum \(S\) of the series, it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
|S - S_n| \lt  a_n\text{.}
\end{equation*}
So the \(n\)th partial sum of a convergent alternating series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (-1)^ka_k\) approximates the actual sum of the series to within \(a_n\).%

Since both sequences \(\left\{\frac{1}{n}\right\}\) and \(\left\{-\frac{1}{n^2}\right\}\) converge to 0 as \(n\) goes to infinity, we see that the sequence of \(n\)th terms of our series converge to 0 as \(n\) goes to infinity.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5313}{}\hypertarget{p-8275}{}%
Notice that \(\frac{1}{k} - \frac{1}{k^2} = \frac{k-1}{k^2}\). So our series can be rewritten as%

\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{k-1}{k^2}\text{.}

\end{equation*}
the Limit Comparison Test shows that the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{k-1}{k^2}\) behaves like the harmonic series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k}\). Since the harmonic series diverges, it follows that the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{k-1}{k^2}\) diverges as well.%

Recall addition of real numbers is commutative; that is%

\par
\hypertarget{p-8286}{}%
The answer is no, and something even more odd happens. Riemann's Theorem (after the nineteenth-century mathematician Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann) states that a conditionally convergent series can be rearranged to converge to \emph{any} prescribed sum. More specifically, this means that if we choose any real number \(S\), we can rearrange the terms of the alternating harmonic series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k}\) so that the sum is \(S\). To understand how Riemann's Theorem works, let's assume for the moment that the number \(S\) we want our rearrangement to converge to is positive. Our job is to find a way to order the sum of terms of the alternating harmonic series to converge to \(S\).%

\hypertarget{p-8296}{}%
So far, each infinite series we have discussed has been a series of real numbers, such as%
\begin{equation}
1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \cdots + \frac{1}{2^k} + \cdots = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^k}\text{.}\label{E-geom12}
\end{equation}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8297}{}%
In the remainder of this chapter, we will include series that involve a variable. For instance, if in the geometric series in \hyperref[E-geom12]{Equation~(\ref{E-geom12})} we replace the ratio \(r = \frac{1}{2}\) with the variable \(x\), we have the infinite (still geometric) series%
\begin{equation}
1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^k + \cdots = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} x^k\text{.}\label{E-geomx}
\end{equation}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8298}{}%
In this section we will focus on more general series of powers.  As a motivation, consider the following example.%
\begin{example}[]\label{Ex-8-6-1}
\hypertarget{p-8299}{}%
Consider the power series defined by%
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^k}{2^k}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8300}{}%
What are \(f(1)\) and \(f\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)\)? Find a general formula for \(f(x)\) and determine the values for which this power series converges.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-442}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-8301}{}%
If we evaluate \(f\) at \(x=1\) we obtain the series%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^k}
\end{equation*}
which is a geometric series with ratio \(\frac{1}{2}\). So we can sum this series and find that%
\begin{equation*}
f(1) = \frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{2}} = 2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8302}{}%
Similarly,%
\begin{equation*}
f(3/2) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^k = \frac{1}{1-\frac{3}{4}} = 4\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8303}{}%
In general, \(f(x)\) is a geometric series with ratio \(\frac{x}{2}\), so%
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^k = \frac{1}{1-\frac{x}{2}} = \frac{2}{2-x}
\end{equation*}
provided that \(-1 \lt  \frac{x}{2} \lt  1\) (which ensures that the ratio is less than 1 in absolute value). Thus, the power series that defines \(f(x)=\frac{2}{2-x}\) converges for \(-2 \lt  x \lt  2\).%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-8304}{}%
As \hyperref[Ex-8-6-1]{Example~\ref{Ex-8-6-1}} illustrates, a power series may converge for some values of \(x\) and not for others. In this section, we will learn how to determine the interval of \(x \)-values where a power series converges. In the following sections we will show how power series may be used to obtain polynomial approximations of functions.%

A \terminology{power series} centered at \(x = a\) is a function of the form%
\begin{equation}
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_k(x-a)^k\label{eq-8-6-power-series}
\end{equation}
where \(\{c_k\}\) is a sequence of real numbers and \(x\) is an independent variable.%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-8306}{}%
For example, the series%
\begin{equation*}
1 + (x-2) + (x-2)^2 + (x-2)^3 + \cdots 
\end{equation*}
is a power series centered at \(x = 2 \) with \(c_i = 1 \) for \(i \ge 1 \), and a geometric series%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}  bx^n = b + bx + bx^2 + bx^3 + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} b(x-0)^n 
\end{equation*}
is a power series centered at \(x=0 \) with \(c_i = b \) for \(i \ge 1 \).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8307}{}%
Convergence of power series is similar to convergence of series. Namely, a power series will converge if its sequence of partial sums converges.  In general, a power series may converge for some values of \(x \), and diverge for others.%
\begin{assemblage}[Convergence of Power Series]\label{assemblage-175}
\hypertarget{p-8308}{}%
For a fixed value of \(x \), the power series%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_k(x-a)^k 
\end{equation*}
\terminology{converges} to \(L \) if the sequence of partial sums \(S_0(x), S_1(x), S_2(x), \ldots \) converges to \(L \). That is,%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} S_n(x) = L \text{.}
\end{equation*}

\par
\hypertarget{p-8309}{}%
The set of \(x\) values at which a power series \(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_k(x-a)^k \) converges is always an interval centered at \(x=a\). For this reason, the set on which a power series converges is called the \terminology{interval of convergence}. Half the length of the interval of convergence is called the \terminology{radius of convergence}.%

\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-5334}{}\hypertarget{p-8317}{}%
To test, we can substitute in \(x=2\) into the series, giving:%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(2-1)^n}{2^n} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n}.
\end{equation*}
This series is geometric with ratio \(\frac{1}{2}\), so it converges (in fact, to 2).%
\item\hypertarget{li-5335}{}\hypertarget{p-8318}{}%
We make the substitution \(x=3\) into the series, and get%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(3-1)^n}{2^n} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{2^n}{2^n} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + \cdots\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Since this series is unbounded, it diverges.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5336}{}\hypertarget{p-8319}{}%
To figure out exactly when the series converges, we'll start by using the Ratio Test. Here \(a_n= \frac{(x-1)^n}{2^n}\). So, notice%
\begin{equation*}
\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\right| = \frac{|x-1|^{n+1}}{2^{n+1}} \cdot \frac{2^n}{|x-1|^n} = \frac{|x-1|}{2}.
\end{equation*}
Thus, the series converges whenever \(\frac{|x-1|}{2}\lt 1 \) and diverges whenever \(\frac{|x-1|}{2} \gt 1 \). Examining that first inequality yields:%
\begin{align*}
\frac{|x-1|}{2} \amp \lt 1 \\
|x-1| \amp \lt 2 \\
-2 \amp\lt x-1 \lt 2 \\
-1 \amp\lt x \lt 3 
\end{align*}
So now we know that the series converges when \(-1 \lt x \lt 3\) and diverges when \(x \lt -1\) and when \(x \gt 3 \). Unfortunately, the ratio test can't tell us what happens exactly at \(x=-1\) or at \(x=3\), because that's when \(\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\right|=1\). However, we can just check those directly. We determined in part b. that the series diverges at \(x=3\), so we just need to check \(x=-1\):%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1-1)^n}{2^n}= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-2)^n}{2^n} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty -1 = -1 -1 -1 \cdots\text{.}
\end{equation*}
This series is unbounded below, so it diverges.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8320}{}%
Thus, the series converges exactly when \(-1 \lt x \lt 3\) and diverges everywhere else.%

A power series defines a function \(f\) whose domain is the set of \(x\) values for which the power series converges. We therefore write%
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_k(x-a)^k\text{.}

%

To determine the values of \(x\) for which a power series%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_k (x-a)^k\text{,}
\end{equation*}
centered at \(x = a\) will converge, we apply the Ratio Test with \(a_k = | c_k (x-a)^k |\). The series converges if \(\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} \lt  1\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8323}{}%
Observe that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{a_{k+1}}{{a_k}} = | x-a | \frac{| c_{k+1} |}{| c_{k} |}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
so when we apply the Ratio Test, we get%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k} = \lim_{k \to \infty} |x-a| \frac{| c_{k+1} |}{| c_{k} |}\text{.}

There are three possibilities for \(L\): \(L\) can be \(0\), it can be a finite positive value, or it can be infinite. Based on this value of \(L\), we can determine for which values of \(x\) the original power series converges.%

If \(L\) is infinite, then the power series converges only at \(x = a\).%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-8330}{}%

\left(a-\frac{1}{L}, a+\frac{1}{L}\right)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
This interval is centered at \(a \) and has radius \(R = \frac{1}{L} \). Because the Ratio Test is inconclusive when the \(|x-a| \cdot L = 1\), the endpoints \(a \pm \frac{1}{L}\) have to be checked separately.%

\hypertarget{p-8336}{}%
First we will plot some of the partial sums of this power series to get an idea of the interval of convergence. Let%
\begin{equation*}
S_n(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{x^k}{k^2}
\end{equation*}
for each \(n \geq 1\). \hyperref[F-8-6-Power-Series]{Figure~\ref{F-8-6-Power-Series}} shows plots of \(S_{10}(x)\) (in red), \(S_{25}(x)\) (in blue), and \(S_{50}(x)\) (in green).%

\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-8337}{}%
The behavior of \(S_{50}\) in particular suggests that \(f(x)\) appears to be converging to a particular curve on the interval \((-1,1)\), while growing without bound outside of that interval. Thus, the interval of convergence might be \(-1 \lt  x \lt  1\). To verify our conjecture, we apply the Ratio Test. Now,%
\begin{equation*}
a_k = \frac{x^k}{k^2}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
so%
\begin{align*}
\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{\left| a_{k+1} \right|}{ \left| a_k \right|} \amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{ \frac{|x|^{k+1}}{(k+1)^2} }{ \frac{| x|^{k}}{k^2} }\\
\amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} |x| \left(\frac{k}{k+1}\right)^2\\
\amp = |x| \lim_{k \to \infty}  \left(\frac{k}{k+1}\right)^2\\
\amp = |x|\text{.}

%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8338}{}%
Therefore, the Ratio Test tells us that \(f(x)\) converges absolutely when \(| x | \lt 1\) and diverges when \(| x | \gt 1\). Because the Ratio Test is inconclusive when \(|x| = 1\), we need to check \(x = 1\) and \(x = -1\) individually.%

When \(x = 1\), observe that%

This is a \(p\)-series with \(p \gt 1\), which we know converges. When \(x = -1\), we have%

\hypertarget{p-8341}{}%
This is an alternating series, and since the sequence \(\left\{ \frac{1}{n^2} \right\}\) decreases to 0, the power series converges by the Alternating Series Test. Thus, the interval of convergence of this power series is \(-1 \le x \le 1\).%

Since the power series is centered at \(x=-2\), the fact that the series converges at \(x=2\) tells us that the radius of convergence is greater than or equal to 4, since 4 is the distance between 2 and -2. Similarly, since the series diverges at \(x=-8\), this tells us that the radius of convergence is less than or equal to 6. Thus, we have \(4 \leq R \leq 6\), and we are guaranteed that if an \(x\) is less than 4 away from \(-2\), then the series will converge there. Similarly, if an \(x\) is more than 6 away from -2, the series must diverge.%

If the power series is centered at  \(x = a \), the power series either converges only at \(x = a \), or it converges for all \(x \in (-\infty, +\infty) \), or  it converges for all \(x \) in a finite interval \((a - R, a + R) \) where \(R \) is the radius of convergence. In the latter case, the power series may or may not converge at the endpoints \(x = a - R \) and \(x = a+R \), so these points have to be checked separately.%

\hypertarget{p-8406}{}%
Polynomial functions are the simplest possible functions in mathematics, in part because they require only addition and multiplication to evaluate. Consequently,  in practical applications, it is often useful to approximate complicated functions using polynomials. In this section we will learn how to obtain polynomial approximations of functions, and how to determine how good an approximation is.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8407}{}%
As an example, consider  the geometric series%
\begin{equation}
1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^k + \cdots = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} x^k\text{.}\label{E-geomx}
\end{equation}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8408}{}%
Here we see something very interesting: because a geometric series converges whenever its ratio \(r\) satisfies \(|r|\lt 1\), and the sum of a convergent geometric series is \(\frac{a}{1-r}\), we can say that for \(|x| \lt  1\),%
\begin{equation}
1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^k + \cdots = \frac{1}{1-x}\text{.}\label{E-geomxsummed}
\end{equation}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8409}{}%
\hyperref[E-geomxsummed]{Equation~(\ref{E-geomxsummed})} states that the non-polynomial function \(\frac{1}{1-x}\) on the right is equal to the infinite polynomial expresssion on the left. Because the terms on the left get very small as \(k\) gets large, we can truncate the series and say, for example, that%
\begin{equation*}
1 + x + x^2 + x^3 \approx \frac{1}{1-x}
\end{equation*}
for small values of \(x\). This shows one way that a polynomial function can be used to approximate a non-polynomial function; such approximations are one of the main themes in this section and the next.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8410}{}%
In \hyperref[PA-8-5]{Example~\ref{PA-8-5}}, we begin our exploration of approximating functions with polynomials.%
\begin{example}[]\label{PA-8-5}
\hypertarget{p-8411}{}%
\hyperref[PA-8-3]{Example~\ref{PA-8-3}} showed how we can approximate the number \(e\) using linear, quadratic, and other polynomial functions; we then used similar ideas in \hyperref[PA-8-4]{Example~\ref{PA-8-4}} to approximate \(\ln(2)\). In this example, we review and extend the process to find the ``best'' quadratic approximation to the exponential function \(e^x\) around the origin. Let \(f(x) = e^x\) throughout this example.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8412}{}%
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-5386}{}\hypertarget{p-8413}{}%
Find a formula for \(P_1(x)\), the linearization of \(f(x)\) at \(x=0\). (We label this linearization \(P_1\) because it is a first degree polynomial approximation.) Recall that \(P_1(x)\) is a good approximation to \(f(x)\) for values of \(x\) close to \(0\). Plot \(f\) and \(P_1\) near \(x=0\) to illustrate this fact.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5387}{}\hypertarget{p-8414}{}%
Since \(f(x) = e^x\) is not linear, the linear approximation eventually is not a very good one. To obtain better approximations, we want to develop a different approximation that ``bends'' to make it more closely fit the graph of \(f\) near \(x=0\). To do so, we  add a quadratic term to \(P_1(x)\). In other words, we let%
\begin{equation*}
P_2(x) = P_1(x) + c_2x^2
\end{equation*}
for some real number \(c_2\). We need to determine the value  of \(c_2\) that makes the graph of \(P_2(x)\) best fit the graph of \(f(x)\) near \(x=0\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8415}{}%
Remember that \(P_1(x)\) was a good linear approximation to \(f(x)\) near \(0\); this is because \(P_1(0) = f(0)\) and \(P'_1(0) = f'(0)\). It is therefore reasonable to seek a value of \(c_2\) so that%
\begin{align*}
P_2(0) \amp = f(0)\text{,} \amp P'_2(0) \amp = f'(0)\text{,} \amp \text{and }P''_2(0) \amp = f''(0)\text{.}
\end{align*}
Remember, we are letting \(P_2(x) = P_1(x) + c_2x^2\).%

Explain why the condition \(P''_2(0) = f''(0)\) will put an appropriate ``bend'' in the graph of \(P_2\) to make \(P_2\) fit the graph of \(f\) around \(x=0\).%

\begin{equation*}
P_1(x) = f(0) + f'(0)x = 1+x\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8423}{}%
Since \(P_1(0) = f(0) = 1\) and \(P'_1(0) = f'(0) = 1\), the graphs of \(P_1\) and \(f\) agree at \(x=a\) and have the same slope at \(x=0\) (which means they go in the same direction at \(x=0\)). This is why \(P_1(x)\) is a good approximation to \(f(x)\) for values of \(x\) close to \(0\).%

%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-5394}{}\hypertarget{p-8425}{}%
Since%
\begin{equation*}
P_2(x) = P_1(x) + c_2(x)^2 = f(0) + f'(0)x + c_2x^2

P_2(0) = 1 = f(0)

A simple calculation shows \(P'_2(x) = P'1(x) + 2c_2x\). So \(P'_2(0) = P'_1(0) = 1 = f'(0)\) as desired.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5396}{}\hypertarget{p-8427}{}%
A simple calculation shows \(P''_2(x) = 2c_2\). So \(P''_2(0) = 2c_2\). To have \(P''_2(0) = f''(0)\) we must have \(2c_2 = f''(0)\) or \(c_2 = \frac{f''(0)}{2} = \frac{1}{2}\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-5397}{}\hypertarget{p-8428}{}%
The second derivative of a function tells us the concavity of the function. Concavity measures how the slopes of the tangent lines to the graph of the function are changing. This tells us how much bend there is in the graph. So if \(P''_2(0) = f''(0)\), then \(P_2\) will have the same bend in it at \(x=0\) as \(f\) does. This will make the graph of \(P_2\) mold to the graph of \(f\) around \(x=0\).%

\index{Taylor polynomials}\hypertarget{p-8429}{}%
\hyperref[PA-8-5]{Example~\ref{PA-8-5}} illustrates the first steps in the process of approximating functions with polynomials. Using this process we can approximate trigonometric, exponential, logarithmic, and other nonpolynomial functions as closely as we like (for certain values of \(x\)) with polynomials. This is extraordinarily useful in that it allows us to calculate values of these functions to whatever precision we like using only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, which can be easily programmed in a computer.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8430}{}%
We next extend the approach in \hyperref[PA-8-5]{Example~\ref{PA-8-5}} to arbitrary functions at arbitrary points. Let \(f\) be a function that has as many derivatives as we need at a point \(x=a\). Recall that \(P_1(x)\) is the tangent line to \(f\) at \((a,f(a))\) and is given by the formula%
\begin{equation*}
P_1(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
\(P_1(x)\) is the linear approximation to \(f\) near \(a\) that has the same slope and function value as \(f\) at the point \(x = a\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8431}{}%
We next want to find a quadratic approximation%
\begin{equation*}
P_2(x) = P_1(x) + c_2(x-a)^2
\end{equation*}
so that \(P_2(x)\) more closely models \(f(x)\) near \(x=a\). Consider the following calculations of the values and derivatives of \(P_2(x)\):%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8432}{}%
%
\begin{align*}
P_2(x) \amp = P_1(x) + c_2(x-a)^2  \amp P_2(a) \amp = P_1(a) = f(a)\\
P'_2(x) \amp = P'_1(x) + 2c_2(x-a) \amp P'_2(a) \amp = P'_1(a) = f'(a)\\
P''_2(x) \amp = 2c_2               \amp P''_2(a) \amp = 2c_2\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8433}{}%
To make \(P_2(x)\) fit \(f(x)\) better than \(P_1(x)\), we want \(P_2(x)\) and \(f(x)\) to have the same concavity at \(x=a\), in addition to having the same slope and function value. That is, we want to have%
\begin{equation*}
P''_2(a) = f''(a)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8434}{}%
This implies that%
\begin{equation*}
2c_2 = f''(a)
\end{equation*}
and thus%
\begin{equation*}
c_2 = \frac{f''(a)}{2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8435}{}%
Therefore, the quadratic approximation \(P_2(x)\) to \(f\) centered at \(x=a\) is%
\begin{equation*}
P_2(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8436}{}%
This approach extends naturally to polynomials of higher degree. We define polynomials%
\begin{align*}
P_3(x) \amp = P_2(x) + c_3(x-a)^3\text{,}\\
P_4(x) \amp = P_3(x) + c_4(x-a)^4\text{,}\\
P_5(x) \amp = P_4(x) + c_5(x-a)^5\text{,}
\end{align*}
and in general%
\begin{equation*}
P_n(x) = P_{n-1}(x) + c_n(x-a)^n\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8437}{}%
The defining property of these polynomials is that for each \(n\), \(P_n(x)\) and all its first \(n\) derivatives must agree with those of \(f\) at \(x = a\). In other words we require that%
\begin{equation*}
P^{(k)}_n(a) = f^{(k)}(a)
\end{equation*}
for all \(k\) from 0 to \(n\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8438}{}%
To see the conditions under which this happens, suppose%
\begin{equation*}
P_n(x) = c_0 + c_1(x-a) + c_2(x-a)^2 + \cdots + c_n(x-a)^n\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8439}{}%
Then%
\begin{align*}
P^{(0)}_n(a) \amp = c_0\\
P^{(1)}_n(a) \amp = c_1\\
P^{(2)}_n(a) \amp = 2c_2\\
P^{(3)}_n(a) \amp = (2)(3)c_3\\
P^{(4)}_n(a) \amp = (2)(3)(4)c_4\\
P^{(5)}_n(a) \amp = (2)(3)(4)(5)c_5
\end{align*}
and, in general,%
\begin{equation*}
P^{(k)}_n(a) = (2)(3)(4) \cdots (k-1)(k)c_k = k!c_k\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8440}{}%
So having \(P^{(k)}_n(a) = f^{(k)}(a)\) means that \(k!c_k = f^{(k)}(a)\) and therefore%
\begin{equation*}
c_k = \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}
\end{equation*}
for each value of \(k\). Using this expression for \(c_k\), we have found the formula for the polynomial approximation of \(f\) that we seek. Such a polynomial is called a \emph{Taylor polynomial}. \index{Taylor polynomial}%

We know that \(f'(x) = e^x\) and so \(f''(x) = e^x\) and \(f'''(x) = e^x\). Thus,%

f(0) = f'(0) = f''(0) = f'''(0) = 1\text{.}

\hypertarget{p-8445}{}%
So the third order Taylor polynomial of \(f(x) = e^x\) centered at \(x=0\) is%
\begin{align*}
P_3(x) \amp = f(0) + f'(0)(x-0) + \frac{f''(0)}{2!}(x-0)^2 + \frac{f'''(0)}{3!}(x-0)^3\\
\amp = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{6}\text{.}

\hypertarget{p-8446}{}%
In general, for the exponential function \(f\) we have \(f^{(k)}(x) = e^x\) for every positive integer \(k\). Thus, the \(k\)th term in the \(n\)th order Taylor polynomial for \(f(x)\) centered at \(x=0\) is%

It is possible that an \(n\)th order Taylor polynomial is not a polynomial of degree \(n\); that is, the order of the approximation can be different from the degree of the polynomial. For example, in \hyperref[act-8-5-2]{Example~\ref{act-8-5-2}} we found that the second order Taylor polynomial \(P_2(x)\) centered at \(0\) for \(\sin(x)\) is \(P_2(x) = x\). In this case, the second order Taylor polynomial is a degree 1 polynomial.%

Notice that \(P_1(x)\) is close to the sine function only for values of \(x\) that are close to \(0\), but as we increase the degree of the Taylor polynomial the Taylor polynomials provide a better fit to the graph of the sine function over larger intervals. This illustrates the general behavior of Taylor polynomials: for any sufficiently well-behaved function, the sequence \(\{P_n(x)\}\) of Taylor polynomials converges to the function \(f\) on larger and larger intervals (though those intervals may not necessarily increase without bound). If the Taylor polynomials ultimately converge to \(f\) on its entire domain, we write%
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k\text{.}

\subsection[{The Interval of Convergence of a Taylor Series}]{The Interval of Convergence of a Taylor Series}\label{subsection-206}
\index{Taylor series!interval of convergence}\index{interval of convergence}\hypertarget{p-8545}{}%
In the previous section (in \hyperref[F-8-5-T1579]{Figure~\ref{F-8-5-T1579}} and \hyperref[act-8-5-3]{Example~\ref{act-8-5-3}}) we observed that the Taylor polynomials centered at \(0\) for \(e^x\), \(\cos(x)\), and \(\sin(x)\) converged to these functions for all values of \(x\) in their domain, but that the Taylor polynomials centered at \(0\) for \(\frac{1}{1-x}\) converge to \(\frac{1}{1-x}\) on the interval \((-1,1)\) and diverge for all other values of \(x\). So the Taylor series for a function \(f(x)\) does not need to converge for all values of \(x\) in the domain of \(f\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8546}{}%
Our observations suggest two natural questions: can we determine the values of \(x\) for which a given Taylor series converges? And does the Taylor series for a function \(f\) actually converge to \(f(x)\)?%
\begin{example}[]\label{Ex-8-5-2}
\hypertarget{p-8547}{}%
Graphical evidence suggests that the Taylor series centered at \(0\) for \(e^x\) converges for all values of \(x\). To verify this, use the Ratio Test to determine all values of \(x\) for which the Taylor series%
\begin{equation}
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^k}{k!}\label{eq-8-5-exponential}
\end{equation}
converges absolutely.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-454}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-8548}{}%
Recall that the Ratio Test applies only to series of nonnegative terms. In this example, the variable \(x\) may have negative values. But we are interested in absolute convergence, so we apply the Ratio Test to the series%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \left| \frac{x^k}{k!} \right| = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{| x |^k}{k!}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8549}{}%
Now, observe that%
\begin{align*}
\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{a_{k+1}}{a_k}   \amp  = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{\frac{| x |^{k+1}}{(k+1)!} }{ \frac{| x |^k}{k} }\\
\amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{| x |^{k+1}k!}{ | x |^{k}(k+1)! }\\
\amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{| x |}{k+1}\\
\amp = 0
\end{align*}
for any value of \(x\). So the Taylor series \hyperref[eq-8-5-exponential]{(\ref{eq-8-5-exponential})} converges absolutely for every value of \(x\), and thus converges for every value of \(x\).%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-8550}{}%
One question still remains: while the Taylor series for \(e^x\) converges for all \(x\), what we have done does not tell us that this Taylor series actually converges to \(e^x\) for each \(x\). We'll return to this question when we consider the error in a Taylor approximation near the end of this section.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8551}{}%
As we did for power series, we define the interval of convergence of a Taylor series  to be the set of values of \(x\) for which the series converges. And as we did with power series, we typically use the Ratio Test to find the values of \(x\) for which the Taylor series converges absolutely, and then check the endpoints separately if the radius of convergence is finite.%

\amp = \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{|x|^{2}}{(2k+3)(2k+2)}\\
\amp = 0\text{.}

So the interval of convergence of the Taylor series for \(f(x) = \sin(x)\) centered at \(x=0\) is \((-\infty, \infty)\).%

\begin{equation*}

\end{equation*}
So the series \(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} x^k\) converges absolutely when \(|x| \lt  1\) or for \(-1 \lt  x \lt  1\) and diverges when \(|x| \gt 1\). Since the Ratio Test doesn't tell us what happens when \(x=1\), we need to check the endpoints separately.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8564}{}%

\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]

When \(x=-1\) we have the series \(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^k\) which diverges since \(\lim_{k \to \infty} (-1)^k\) does not exist.%

%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8567}{}%
Therefore, the interval of convergence of the Taylor series for \(f(x) = \frac{1}{1-x}\) centered at \(x=0\) is \((-1,1)\).%

\hypertarget{p-8568}{}%
The Ratio Test allows us to determine the set of \(x\) values for which a Taylor series converges absolutely. However, just because a Taylor series for a function \(f\) converges, we cannot be certain that the Taylor series actually converges to \(f(x)\). To show why and where a Taylor series does in fact converge to the function \(f\), we next consider the error that is present in Taylor polynomials.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsection 7.6.5 Error Approximations for Taylor Polynomials}

\subsection[{Error Approximations for Taylor Polynomials}]{Error Approximations for Taylor Polynomials}\label{subsection-207}
\index{Taylor polynomial!error}\hypertarget{p-8569}{}%
We now know how to find Taylor polynomials for functions such as \(\sin(x)\), and how to determine the interval of convergence of the corresponding Taylor series. We next develop an error bound that will tell us how well an \(n\)th order Taylor polynomial \(P_n(x)\) approximates its generating function \(f(x)\). This error bound will also allow us to determine whether a Taylor series on its interval of convergence actually equals the function \(f\) from which the Taylor series is derived. Finally, we will be able to use the error bound to determine the order of the Taylor polynomial \(P_n(x)\) that we will ensure that \(P_n(x)\) approximates \(f(x)\) to the desired degree of accuracy.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8570}{}%
For this argument, we assume throughout that we center our approximations at \(0\) (but a similar argument holds for approximations centered at \(a\)). We define the exact error, \(E_n(x)\), that results from approximating \(f(x)\) with \(P_n(x)\) by%
\begin{equation*}
E_n(x) = f(x) - P_n(x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8571}{}%
We are particularly interested in \(|E_n(x)|\), the distance between \(P_n\) and \(f\). Because%
\begin{equation*}
P^{(k)}_n(0) = f^{(k)}(0)
\end{equation*}
for \(0 \leq k \leq n\), we know that%
\begin{equation*}
E^{(k)}_n(0) = 0
\end{equation*}
for \(0 \leq k \leq n\). Furthermore, since \(P_n(x)\) is a polynomial of degree less than or equal to \(n\), we know that%
\begin{equation*}
P_n^{(n+1)}(x) = 0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8572}{}%
Thus, since \(E^{(n+1)}_n(x) = f^{(n+1)}(x) - P_n^{(n+1)}(x)\), it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
E^{(n+1)}_n(x) = f^{(n+1)}(x)
\end{equation*}
for all \(x\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8573}{}%
Suppose that we want to approximate \(f(x)\) at a number \(c\) close to \(0\) using \(P_n(c)\). If we assume \(|f^{(n+1)}(t)|\) is bounded by some number \(M\) on \([0, c]\), so that%
\begin{equation*}
\left|f^{(n+1)}(t)\right| \leq M
\end{equation*}
for all \(0 \leq t \leq c\), then we can say that%
\begin{equation*}
\left|E^{(n+1)}_n(t)\right| = \left|f^{(n+1)}(t)\right| \leq M
\end{equation*}
for all \(t\) between \(0\) and \(c\). Equivalently,%
\begin{equation}
-M \leq E^{(n+1)}_n(t) \leq M\label{E-ErrorIneq}
\end{equation}
on \([0, c]\). Next, we integrate the three terms in \hyperref[E-ErrorIneq]{Inequality~(\ref{E-ErrorIneq})} from \(t = 0\) to \(t = x\), and thus find that%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^x -M \ dt \leq \int_0^x E^{(n+1)}_n(t) \ dt \leq \int_0^x M \ dt
\end{equation*}
for every value of \(x\) in \([0, c]\). Since \(E^{(n)}_n(0) = 0\), the First FTC tells us that%
\begin{equation*}
-Mx \leq E^{(n)}_n(x) \leq Mx
\end{equation*}
for every \(x\) in \([0, c]\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8574}{}%
Integrating this last inequality, we obtain%
\begin{equation*}
\int_0^x -Mt \ dt \leq \int_0^x E^{(n)}_n(t) \ dt \leq \int_0^x Mt \ dt
\end{equation*}
and thus%
\begin{equation*}
-M\frac{x^2}{2} \leq E^{(n-1)}_n(x) \leq M\frac{x^2}{2}
\end{equation*}
for all \(x\) in \([0, c]\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8575}{}%
Integrating \(n\) times, we arrive at%
\begin{equation*}
-M\frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} \leq E_n(x) \leq M\frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}
\end{equation*}
for all \(x\) in \([0, c]\). This enables us to conclude that%
\begin{equation*}
\left|E_n(x)\right| \leq M\frac{|x|^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}
\end{equation*}
for all \(x\) in \([0, c]\), and we have found a bound on the approximation's error, \(E_n\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8576}{}%
Our work above was based on the approximation centered at \(a = 0\); the argument may be generalized to hold for any value of \(a\), which results in the following theorem.%
\begin{assemblage}[The Lagrange Error Bound for \(P_n(x)\)]\label{assemblage-179}
\hypertarget{p-8577}{}%
Let \(f\) be a continuous function with \(n+1\) continuous derivatives. Suppose that \(M\) is a positive real number such that \(\left|f^{(n+1)}(x)\right| \le M\) on the interval \([a, c]\). If \(P_n(x)\) is the \(n\)th order Taylor polynomial for \(f(x)\) centered at \(x=a\), then%
\begin{equation*}
\left|P_n(c) - f(c)\right| \leq M\frac{|c-a|^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-8578}{}%
We can use this error bound to tell us important information about Taylor polynomials and Taylor series, as we see in the following examples and activities.%
\begin{example}[]\label{Ex-8-5-3}
\hypertarget{p-8579}{}%
Determine how well the 10th order Taylor polynomial \(P_{10}(x)\) for \(\sin(x)\), centered at \(0\), approximates \(\sin(2)\).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-456}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-8580}{}%
To answer this question we use \(f(x) = \sin(x)\), \(c = 2\), \(a=0\), and \(n = 10\) in the Lagrange error bound formula. We also need to find an appropriate value for \(M\). Note that the derivatives of \(f(x) = \sin(x)\) are all equal to \(\pm \sin(x)\) or \(\pm \cos(x)\). Thus,%
\begin{equation*}
\left| f^{(n+1)}(x) \right| \leq 1
\end{equation*}
for any \(n\) and \(x\). Therefore, we can choose \(M\) to be \(1\). Then%
\begin{equation*}
\left|P_{10}(2) - f(2)\right| \leq (1)\frac{|2-0|^{11}}{(11)!} = \frac{2^{11}}{(11)!} \approx 0.00005130671797\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8581}{}%
So \(P_{10}(2)\) approximates \(\sin(2)\) to within at most \(0.00005130671797\). A computer algebra system tells us that%
\begin{equation*}
P_{10}(2) \approx 0.9093474427 \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \sin(2) \approx 0.9092974268
\end{equation*}
with an actual difference of about \(0.0000500159\).%
\end{example}
\begin{example}[]\label{act-8-5-5}
\hypertarget{p-8582}{}%
Let \(P_n(x)\) be the \(n\)th order Taylor polynomial for \(\sin(x)\) centered at \(x=0\). Determine how large we need to choose \(n\) so that \(P_n(2)\) approximates \(\sin(2)\) to \(20\) decimal places.%

\hypertarget{p-8584}{}%
In this example, if we can find a value of \(n\) so that%
\begin{equation*}
M\frac{|2-0|^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} \lt  10^{-20}
\end{equation*}
then we will have%
\begin{equation*}
|P_n(2) - f(2)| \leq M\frac{|2-0|^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} \lt  10^{-20}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8585}{}%
Again we use \(f(x) = \sin(x)\), \(c = 2\), \(a=0\), and \(M = 1\) from the previous example. So we need to find \(n\) to make%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{2^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} \leq 10^{-20}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8586}{}%
There is no good way to solve equations involving factorials, so we simply use trial and error, evaluating \(\frac{2^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}\) at different values of \(n\) until we get one we need.%

\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-458}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-8590}{}%
Recall from the previous example that since \(f(x) = \sin(x)\), we know%
\begin{equation*}
\left| f^{(n+1)}(x) \right| \leq 1
\end{equation*}
for any \(n\) and \(x\). This allows us to choose \(M = 1\) in the Lagrange error bound formula. Thus,%
\begin{equation}
|P_n(x) - \sin(x)| \leq \frac{|x|^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}\label{E-ErrorIneqSine}
\end{equation}
for every \(x\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8591}{}%
We showed in earlier work that the Taylor series \(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^k}{k!}\) converges for every value of \(x\). Because the terms of any convergent series must approach zero, it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} = 0
\end{equation*}
for every value of \(x\). Thus, taking the limit as \(n \to \infty\) in the inequality~\hyperref[E-ErrorIneqSine]{(\ref{E-ErrorIneqSine})}, it follows that%

\lim_{n \to \infty} |P_n(x) - \sin(x)| = 0\text{.}

Let \(x \ge 0\). Since \(f(x) = e^x\), \(f^{(n)}(x) = e^x\) for every natural number \(n\). Since \(e^x\) is an increasing function, we know that \(|f^{(n)}(x)| \le e^c\) on the interval \([0,c]\) for any fixed positive value of \(c\). Thus, by the Lagrange error formula, we can say that%
\begin{equation*}
|P_n(x) - e^x| \le e^c \frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Since the series \(\sum \frac{x^{n}}{n!}\) converges for every \(x\), \(\frac{x^{n}}{n!} \to 0\) as \(x \to \infty\), and thus \(\frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} \to 0\) as \(n \to \infty\) for every \(x\) in \([0,c]\). Further, since \(e^c\) is a constant independent of \(n\), \(e^c \frac{x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} \to 0\) as well. Thus,%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{n \to \infty} |P_n(x) - e^x| = 0\text{,}

as desired.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5486}{}\hypertarget{p-8611}{}%

Because we have shown that the Taylor series for \(e^x\) converges to \(e^x\) for both every nonnegative \(x\)-value and for every negative \(x\)-value, it follows that we have convergence for every value of \(x\).%

Since \(e^x\) is increasing on \([0,5]\) we know that \(e^x \lt e^5\) on \([0,5]\). Now \(e^5 \lt 243\), so%
\begin{equation*}
\left|P_n(5) - e^5\right| \leq 243\frac{|5|^{n+1}}{(n+1)!}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
We want a value of \(n\)that makes this error term less than \(10^{-8}\). Testing various values of \(n\) gives%
\begin{equation*}
243\frac{|5|^{28+1}}{(28+1)!} \approx 5.119146745 \times 10^{-9}
\end{equation*}
so we can choose \(n = 28\). A computer algebra system shows that \(P_{28}(5) \approx 148.413159102551\) while \(e^5 \approx 148.413159102577\) and we can see that these two approximations agree to 8 decimal places.%

We can use Taylor polynomials to approximate functions. This allows us to approximate values of functions using only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of real numbers. The \(n\)th order Taylor polynomial centered at \(x=a\) of a function \(f\) is%
\begin{align*}
P_n(x) =\mathstrut \amp  f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 + \cdots + \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n\\

The \(n\)th order Taylor polynomial centered at \(a\) for \(f\) is the \(n\)th partial sum of its Taylor series centered at \(a\). So the \(n\)th order Taylor polynomial for a function \(f\) is an approximation to \(f\) on the interval where the Taylor series converges; for the values of \(x\) for which the Taylor series converges to \(f\) we write%

We can often assume a solution to a given problem can be written as a power series, then use the information in the problem to determine the coefficients in the power series. This method allows us to approximate solutions to certain problems using partial sums of the power series; that is, we can find approximate solutions that are polynomials.%

The Lagrange Error Bound shows us how to determine the accuracy in using a Taylor polynomial to approximate a function.

Observe that \(f'(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 3\), \(f''(x) = 6x - 4\), and \(f'''(x) = 6\), so \(f'(0) = 3\), \(f''(0) = -4\), and \(f'''(0) = 6\). In addition, \(f(0) = -1\)  Thus, the 3rd order Taylor polynomial centered at \(a = 0\) is%

P_3(x) = -1 + 3x - \frac{4}{2!}x^2 + \frac{6}{3!}x^3\text{.}

Since \(f^{(4)}(x) = 0\) for all \(x\), \(f^{(4)}(0) = 0\), and similarly every higher derivative of \(f\) will be zero.

We have now built several examples of Taylor series using the definition, and we have seen in the process that nearly all of the work needed to find a Taylor series is done in finding the coefficients. This can be done for any function by taking derivatives; however, some functions have very complicated derivatives, and the process of finding these derivatives can take a serious amount of time and effort.%

There are several ways we can obtain Taylor series expansions for functions using known Taylor series expansions for different related functions.

\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-463}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-8676}{}%
We'll begin with the Taylor series for \(\sin(x)\) about \(x=0\), and build the desired series from there.%
\begin{equation*}
\sin(x)=x-\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^5}{5!}-\frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots 
\end{equation*}
Next, substitute \(t^3\) in for \(x\):%
\begin{align*}
\sin(t^3) \amp= t^3 - \frac{(t^3)^3}{3!} + \frac{(t^3)^5}{5!} - \frac{(t^3)^7}{7!} + \cdots \\
\amp = t^3 - \frac{t^9}{3!} + \frac{t^{15}}{5!} - \frac{t^{21}}{7!} + \cdots 
\end{align*}
Now multiply the entire series by \(t\):%
\begin{equation*}
t \sin (t^3) = t^4 - \frac{t^{10}}{3!} + \frac{t^{16}}{5!} - \frac{t^{22}}{7!} + \cdots 
\end{equation*}
And finally, subtract t^4:%
\begin{equation*}
t\sin(t^3)-t^4 = -\frac{t^{10}}{3!} + \frac{t^{16}}{5!} - \frac{t^{22}}{7!} + \cdots 
\end{equation*}
Now that we've got the final series, we can write this with \(\Sigma\)-notation, as well:%
\begin{equation*}
t\sin(t^3)-t^4 = \sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^{k}\frac{t^{3(2k+1)+1}}{(2k+1)!} = \sum_{k=1}^\infty (-1)^k \frac{t^{6k+4}}{(2k+1)!}

Our work in \hyperref[act-8-6-3]{Example~\ref{act-8-6-3}} holds more generally. The corresponding theorem, which we will not prove, states that we can differentiate a power series for a function \(f\) term by term and obtain the series expansion for \(f'\), and similarly we can integrate a series expansion for a function \(f\) term by term and obtain the series expansion for \(\int f(x) \ dx\). For both, the radius of convergence of the resulting series is the same as the original, though it is possible that the convergence status of the various series may differ at the endpoints. The formal statement of the Power Series Differentiation and Integration Theorem follows.%
\begin{assemblage}[Power Series Differentiation and Integration Theorem]\label{assemblage-181}
\hypertarget{p-8691}{}%
Suppose \(f(x)\) has a power series expansion%
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_kx^k
\end{equation*}
and that the series converges absolutely to \(f(x)\) on the interval \(-r \lt  x \lt  r\). Then, the power series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} kc_kx^{k-1}\) obtained by differentiating the power series for \(f(x)\) term by term converges absolutely to \(f'(x)\) on the interval \(-r \lt  x \lt  r\). That is,%
\begin{equation*}
f'(x) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} kc_kx^{k-1}, \ \text{for}  \ |x| \lt  r\text{.}

\begin{equation*}
\int f(x) \ dx = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_k\frac{x^{k+1}}{k+1} + C, \ \text{for}  \ |x| \lt  r\text{.}

This theorem validates the steps we took in \hyperref[act-8-6-3]{Example~\ref{act-8-6-3}}. It tells us that we can differentiate and integrate term by term on the interior of the interval of convergence, but it does not tell us what happens at the endpoints of this interval. We always need to check what happens at the endpoints separately. More importantly, we can use use the approach of differentiating or integrating a series term by term to find new series.%

as the Taylor series for \(\sin(x^2)\) centered at \(x=0\). We can integrate a Taylor series term by term on its interval of convergence, so%
\begin{align*}
\int \sin(x^2) \, dx &= \int \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^k\frac{x^{2(2k+1)}}{(2k+1)!} \, dx\\

\begin{align*}
\int_0^1 \sin(x^2) \, dx &= \left. \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^k\frac{x^{4k+3}}{(2k+1)!(4k+3)}\right|_{0}^{1}\\
&= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^k\frac{1}{(2k+1)!(4k+3)}\text{.}

The resulting series is an alternating series, so we can find a value of \(n\) that makes the \(n\)th partial sum of the series approximate the sum of the series to \(3\) decimal places by determining a value of \(n\) such that%
\begin{equation*}
a_{n+1} = \frac{1}{(2(n+1)+1)!(4(n+1)+3)} \lt 0.001\text{.}

This is not an inequality that we can solve algebraically, so we use trial and error. Doing so shows that \(n = 1\) will work.%

\hypertarget{p-8708}{}%
There are many applications of Taylor series, but most are based on the idea of using Taylor series to approximate function values. For example, say we have a function \(f(x)\) and we knew the Taylor series for \(f(x)\) and we really need to get an approximate value for \(f(1)\). Assuming that the Taylor series converges for \(x=1\), we can then substitute \(x=1\) into the series, and use the first few terms of the series to approximate the number. Of course, using more terms of the series gives a better approximation. The examples below walk through how this is done in more details, and highlights some of the different ways in which it can be useful.%

While we could differentiate \(\arctan(x)\) repeatedly and look for patterns in the derivative values at \(x = 0\) in an attempt to find the Maclaurin series for \(\arctan(x)\) from the definition, it turns out to be far easier to use a known series in an insightful way. By thinking of the right-hand side as a geometric series, we can see that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{1+x^2} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^k x^{2k}
\end{equation*}
for \(-1 \lt  x \lt  1\). Recall that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx} \left[ \arctan(x) \right] = \frac{1}{1+x^2}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and therefore%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{1}{1+x^2} \ dx = \arctan(x) + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8713}{}%
It follows that we can integrate the series for \(\frac{1}{1+x^2}\) term by term to obtain the power series expansion for \(\arctan(x)\). Doing so, we find that%
\begin{align*}
\arctan(x) \amp = \int \left( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^kx^{2k} \right) \ dx\\
\amp = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \left( \int (-1)^k x^{2k} \ dx \right)\\
\amp = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^k\frac{x^{2k+1}}{2k+1} \right) + C\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8714}{}%
The Power Series Differentiation and Integration Theorem tells us that this equality is valid for at least \(-1 \lt x \lt 1\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8715}{}%
To find the value of the constant \(C\), we can use the fact that \(\arctan(0) = 0\). So%
\begin{equation*}
0 = \arctan(0) = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^k\frac{0^{2k+1}}{2k+1} \right) + C = C\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and we must have \(C = 0\). Therefore,%
\begin{equation}
\arctan(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^k\frac{x^{2k+1}}{2k+1}\label{E-arctanseries}
\end{equation}
for at least \(-1 \lt  x \lt  1\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8716}{}%
It is a straightforward exercise to check that the power series%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^k\frac{x^{2k+1}}{2k+1}
\end{equation*}
converges both when \(x = -1\) and when \(x = 1\); in each case, we have an alternating series with terms \(\frac{1}{2k+1}\) that decrease to \(0\), and thus the interval of convergence for the series expansion for \(\arctan(x)\) in Equation~\hyperref[E-arctanseries]{(\ref{E-arctanseries})} is \(-1 \le x \le 1\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-5548}{}\hypertarget{p-8717}{}%
To make the computations a little easier, let's write out the first five terms of the Taylor series explicitly:%
\begin{equation*}
\arctan(x)= x-\frac{x^3}{3}+\frac{x^5}{5}-\frac{x^7}{7}+\frac{x^9}{9} - \cdots 
\end{equation*}
With \(x=1\), we have%
\begin{equation*}
\arctan(1)=1-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5}-\frac{1}{7}+\frac{1}{9}-\cdots 
\end{equation*}
So, if we use just the first term to approximate, we would have%
\begin{equation*}
\pi = 4\arctan(1) \approx 4(1)=4, 
\end{equation*}
giving the table entry for \(n=1\). For \(n=2\), we use the first two terms:%
\begin{equation*}
\pi = 4 \arctan(1) \approx 4\left(1-\frac{1}{3}\right)=4\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \approx 2.6667. 
\end{equation*}
Continuing, for \(n=3\):%
\begin{equation*}
\pi \approx 4\left(1-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5}\right) = 4 \left(\frac{13}{15}\right)\approx 3.4667. 
\end{equation*}
The completed table is as follows.%

We'll need to build all three Taylor series, and then compare them. There's a brief outline of each construction below.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8725}{}%
For \(\sin(y^2)\):%
\begin{align*}
\sin(x)\amp=x-\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^5}{5!}-\frac{x^7}{7!} + \frac{x^9}{9!} - \cdots \\
\sin(y^2) \amp=y^2 - \frac{y^6}{3!} +\frac{x^{10}}{5!} - \frac{x^{14}}{7!} + \frac{x^{18}}{9!} 
\end{align*}
For \(1-\cos(y)\):%
\begin{align*}
\cos(y)\amp=1-\frac{y^2}{2!}+\frac{y^4}{4!}-\frac{y^6}{6!} +\frac{y^8}{8!} - \cdots \\
1-\cos(y) \amp= \frac{y^2}{2!} - \frac{y^4}{4!} + \frac{y^6}{6!} - \frac{y^8}{8!} + \cdots 
\end{align*}
For \(\ln(1+y^2)\)%
\begin{align*}
\ln(1+t) \amp= t-\frac{t^2}{2}+\frac{t^3}{3}-\frac{t^4}{4} + \frac{t^5}{5} - \cdots \\
\ln(1+y^2)\amp= y^2 - \frac{y^4}{2}+\frac{y^6}{3}-\frac{y^8}{4} + \frac{y^{10}}{5} - \cdots 
\end{align*}
Now, let's use, say, the degree six taylor polynomials as an estimate, and compare the three series. For values of \(y\) near 0, we have%
\begin{align*}
\sin(y^2) \amp\approx y^2 - \frac{y^6}{3!} \\
1-\cos(y) \amp\approx \frac{y^2}{2!} - \frac{y^4}{4!} + \frac{y^6}{6!}\\
\ln(1+y^2) \amp\approx y^2 - \frac{y^4}{2} + \frac{y^6}{3} 
\end{align*}
We can compare term-by-term and decide which is smaller, or we can plug in a value near 0 to all three approximations; say, \(y=0.5\)%
\begin{align*}
\sin((0.5)^2) \amp \approx (0.5)^2 - \frac{(0.5)^6}{3!} \approx 0.2474 \\
1-\cos(0.5) \amp\approx \frac{(0.5)^2}{2!} - \frac{(0.5)^4}{4!} + \frac{(0.5)^6}{6!} \approx 0.1224\\
\ln(1+(0.5)^2) \amp\approx (0.5)^2 - \frac{(0.5)^4}{2} + \frac{(0.5)^6}{3} \approx 0.2234 
\end{align*}
Thus, the order is \(1-\cos(y) \leq \ln(1+y^2)\leq \sin(y^2) \)%
\item\hypertarget{li-5557}{}\hypertarget{p-8726}{}%
We'll plug in \(y=1\) to the Taylor series for \(sin(y^2)\):%
\begin{equation*}
\sin(1) \approx 1^2 - \frac{1^6}{3!} + \frac{1^{10}}{5!} - \frac{1^{14}}{7!} \approx 0.84145 
\end{equation*}

This series looks a lot like%
\begin{equation*}
1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \frac{x^6}{6!} + \cdots 
\end{equation*}
where \(x=2\) has been plugged in. We can recognize that this is the Taylor series for \(\cos(x)\) centered at 0, and since it converges for all real numbers \(x\), the sum of the series must be \(\cos(2)\).%

What are differential equations? How are they useful?%

\hypertarget{p-8748}{}%
In \hyperref[sec-5-3-diff]{Section~\ref{sec-5-3-diff}}, we learned that a \emph{differential equation} is an equation that provides a description of a function's derivative, which means that it tells us the function's rate of change. In this chapter we will learn several methods for solving differential equations. We start by revisiting what a differential equation is.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8749}{}%
Differential equations arise frequently in our every day world. For instance, you may hear a bank advertising:%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-17}{}
\hypertarget{p-8750}{}%
\emph{Your money will grow at a 3\% annual interest rate with us.}%
\end{quote}
\hypertarget{p-8751}{}%
This innocuous statement is really a differential equation. Let's translate: \(A(t)\) will be amount of money you have in your account at time \(t\). The rate at which your money grows is the derivative \(dA/dt\), and we are told that this rate is \(0.03 A\). This leads to the differential equation%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dA}{dt} = 0.03 A\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8752}{}%
This differential equation has a slightly different feel than the previous equation \(\frac{ds}{dt} = 4t+1\). In the earlier example, the rate of change depends only on the independent variable \(t\), and we may find \(s(t)\) by integrating the velocity \(4t+1\). In the banking example, however, the rate of change depends on the dependent variable \(A\), so we'll need some new techniques in order to find \(A(t)\).%

Differential equations give a natural way to describe phenomena we see in the real world. For instance, physical principles are frequently expressed as a description of how a quantity changes. A good example is Newton's Second Law, which says:%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-18}{}
\hypertarget{p-8774}{}%
\emph{The product of an object's mass and acceleration equals the force applied to it.}%
\end{quote}
\hypertarget{p-8775}{}%
For instance, when gravity acts on an object near the earth's surface, it exerts a force equal to \(mg\), the mass of the object times the gravitational constant \(g\). We therefore have%
\begin{align*}
ma =\mathstrut \amp  mg, \ \text{or}\\
\frac{dv}{dt} =\mathstrut \amp  g\text{,}
\end{align*}
where \(v\) is the velocity of the object, and \(g = 9.8\) meters per second squared. Notice that this physical principle does not tell us what the object's velocity is, but rather how the object's velocity changes.%
\begin{example}[]\label{act-7-1-2}
\hypertarget{p-8776}{}%
Shown below are two graphs depicting the velocity of falling objects. On the left is the velocity of a skydiver, while on the right is the velocity of a meteorite entering the Earth's atmosphere.%

The velocity decreases when \(\frac{dv}{dt} \lt 0\). So the velocity decreases when \(3 \lt v \lt 5\).%

\hypertarget{p-8804}{}%
To close this section, we note that differential equations may be classified based on certain characteristics they may possess. You may see many different types of differential equations in a later course in differential equations. For now, we would like to introduce a few terms that are used to describe differential equations.%
\begin{assemblage}[Order of a differential equation]\label{assemblage-182}
\hypertarget{p-8805}{}%
The \terminology{order} of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative that appears in the equation.%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-8806}{}%
For example, a \emph{first-order} differential equation \index{differential equation!first order} is one in which only the first derivative of the function occurs. For this reason,%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dv}{dt} = 1.5-0.5v
\end{equation*}
is a first-order equation while%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = -10y
\end{equation*}
is a second-order equation.%
\begin{assemblage}[Autonomous differential equation]\label{assemblage-183}
\hypertarget{p-8807}{}%
A differential equation is \terminology{autonomous} \index{autonomous} \index{differential equation!autonomous} if the independent variable does not appear in the description of the derivative.%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-8808}{}%
For instance,%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dv}{dt} = 1.5-0.5v
\end{equation*}
is autonomous because the description of the derivative \(dv/dt\) does not depend on time. The equation%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dt} = 1.5t - 0.5y\text{,}
\end{equation*}
however, is not autonomous.%

The fact that \(T(0) = 105\) tells us the coffee's temperature at time \(t = 0\) is \(T = 105\) degrees F, and \(\frac{dT}{dt}\vert_{T=105} = -2\) tells us that at the instant \(T = 105\) (i.e. when \(t = 0\)), the coffee's temperature is decreasing at an instantaneous rate of \(-2\) degrees F per minute.%

In the previous question, we observed that \(75\) degrees F is the critical temperature that changes the behavior of \(T\). There are several reasons to think that \(75\) degrees F is room temperature: if the coffee's temperature is above room temperature (\(75\)), its temperature will decrease to room temperature, while if the coffee is below room temperature, its temperature will increase to room temperature.

Verify that \(T(t) = 75 + 30e^{-t/15}\) is the solution to the differential equation with initial value \(T(0) = 105\). What happens to this solution after a long time? Assuming that \(T(t) = 75 + 30e^{-t/15}\), we observe that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dT}{dt} = 30e^{-t/15} \left(-\frac{1}{15} \right) = -2e^{-t/15}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
In addition,%
\begin{equation*}
-\frac{1}{15}T + 5 = -\frac{1}{15}(75 + 30e^{-t/15}) + 5 = -5 - 2e^{-t/15} + 5 = -2e^{-t/15}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
The two preceding equations show that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dT}{dt}= -\frac1{15}T+5
\end{equation*}
when we substitute \(T(t) = 75 + 30e^{-t/15}\) in for \(T\), and thus this function is a solution to the differential equation. Moreover, \(T(0) = 75 + 30e^0 = 75 + 30 = 105\), so the function satisfies the initial condition, too. Finally, because \(e^{-t/15} \to 0\) as \(t \to \infty\), it follows that \(T(t) = 75 + 30e^{-t/15} \to 75\) as \(t \to \infty\), which shows that the solution function's value tends to room temperature as time increases without bound, as we expect.%

To see if \(y(t) = t + 1 + 2e^t\) is a solution to \(\frac{dy}{dt} = y - t\), we compute \(\frac{dy}{dt}\) and \(y - t\) separately and see if they are equal.  First, using \(y(t) = t + 1 + 2e^t\),%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dt} = 1 + 2e^t\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Next,%
\begin{equation*}
y - t = ( t + 1 + 2e^t ) - t = 1 + 2e^t\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Thus, \(y(t) = t + 1 + 2e^t\) satisfies the DE and is indeed a solution.%

\begin{equation*}
\frac{dh}{dt} = 12\cos(3t)

and%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d^2h}{dt^2} = -36\sin(3t)\text{.}

To satisfy the DE%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d^2h}{dt^2} = -kh\text{,}

it follows that we must have \(-36\sin(3t) = -kh = -k \cdot 4\sin(3t)\). Thus, we need \(-36 = -4k\), and hence \(k = 9\).%

In earlier work, we have used the tangent line to the graph of a function \(f\) at a point \(a\) to approximate the values of \(f\) near \(a\). The usefulness of this approximation is that we need to know very little about the function; armed with only the value \(f(a)\) and the derivative \(f'(a)\), we may find the equation of the tangent line and the approximation%
\begin{equation*}
f(x) \approx f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8879}{}%
Remember that a first-order differential equation gives us information about the derivative of an unknown function. Since the derivative at a point tells us the slope of the tangent line at this point, a differential equation gives us crucial information about the tangent lines to the graph of a solution. We will use this information about the tangent lines to create a \emph{slope field} for the differential equation, which enables us to sketch solutions to initial value problems. Our aim will be to understand the solutions qualitatively. That is, we would like to understand the basic nature of solutions, such as their long-range behavior, without precisely determining the value of a solution at a particular point.%

\hyperref[PA-7-2]{Example~\ref{PA-7-2}} shows that we can sketch the solution to an initial value problem if we know an appropriate collection of tangent lines. We can use the differential equation to find the slope of the tangent line at any point of interest, and hence plot such a collection.%

Let's continue looking at the differential equation \(\frac{dy}{dt} = t-2\). If \(t=0\), this equation says that \(dy/dt = 0-2=-2\). Note that this value holds regardless of the value of \(y\). We will therefore sketch tangent lines for several values of \(y\) and \(t=0\) with a slope of \(-2\), as shown in \hyperref[F-7-2-field-0]{Figure~\ref{F-7-2-field-0}}.%

Whenever the solution passes through a point at which a tangent line is drawn, that line is tangent to the solution.

\hypertarget{p-8913}{}%
As our work in \hyperref[act-7-2-1]{Example~\ref{act-7-2-1}} demonstrates, first-order autonomous equations may have solutions that are constant. These are simple to detect by inspecting the differential equation \(dy/dt = f(y)\): constant solutions necessarily have a zero derivative, so \(dy/dt = 0 = f(y)\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8914}{}%
For example, in \hyperref[act-7-2-1]{Example~\ref{act-7-2-1}}, we considered the equation \(\frac{dy}{dt} = f(y)=-\frac12(y-4)\). Constant solutions are found by setting \(f(y) = -\frac12(y-4) = 0\), which we immediately see implies that \(y = 4\).%
\begin{assemblage}[Equilibrium solutions]\label{assemblage-185}
\hypertarget{p-8915}{}%
Values of \(y\) for which \(f(y) = 0\) in an autonomous differential equation \(\frac{dy}{dt} = f(y)\) are called \terminology{equilibrium solutions} of the differential equation.%
\end{assemblage}
\begin{assemblage}[Stable vs. unstable solutions]\label{assemblage-186}
\hypertarget{p-8916}{}%
An equilibrium solution \(\overline{y}\) is called \terminology{stable} if nearby solutions converge to \(\overline{y}\). This means that if the initial condition varies slightly from \(\overline{y}\), then \(\lim_{t\to\infty}y(t) = \overline{y}\). Conversely, an equilibrium solution \(\overline{y}\) is called \terminology{unstable} if nearby solutions are pushed away from \(\overline{y}\).%

A slope field is a plot created by graphing the tangent lines of many different solutions to a differential equation.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-8942}{}%
Once we have a slope field, we may sketch the graph of solutions by drawing a curve that is always tangent to the lines in the slope field.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-8943}{}%
Autonomous differential equations sometimes have constant solutions that we call equilibrium solutions. These may be classified as stable or unstable, depending on the behavior of nearby solutions.%

By following the slope field so that we pass through the points \((0,-4)\), \((0,-3)\), \(\ldots\), \((0,4)\), we see the collection of curves in the figure above.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5725}{}\hypertarget{p-8957}{}%
It looks like the solution that passes through \((0,-1)\) is a straight line with slope \(m = 1\), and thus has the formula \(y(t) = t-1\). To verify this function is a solution, we compute both \(\frac{dy}{dt}\) and \(t-y\). Doing so, we see%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dt} = 1
\end{equation*}
and%
\begin{equation*}
t-y = t - (t-1) = 1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Thus, \(y(t) = t-1\) is indeed a solution to the differential equation.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5726}{}\hypertarget{p-8958}{}%
From both the differential equation and the graphs we have sketched, it appears that \(t\) and \(y\) are equal at any point where a solution has a local minimum. This is because when \(t = y\), \(\frac{dy}{dt} = t - y = 0\), and having the derivative be zero is required for any local minimum on a differentiable function.%

Moreover, we see that \(\frac{dP}{dt} \gt 0\) when \(P \lt 0\) or \(1 \lt P \lt 3\), and \(\frac{dP}{dt} \lt 0\) otherwise. The closer \(P\) is to \(0\), \(1\), or \(3\), the closer \(\frac{dP}{dt}\) is to \(0\). This leads us to sketch a direction field like the following.%

Following the slope field plotted above, we see that any solution curve that starts with \(P(0) \gt 3\) will decrease to \(P(t) = 3\) as \(t \to \infty\). Any curve that starts with \(1 \lt P(0) \lt 3\) will increase to \(P(t) = 3\). And any curve that starts with \(0 \lt P(0) \lt 1\) will decrease to \(P(t) = 0\).%

The equilibrium solutions are the values of \(P\) where \(\frac{dP}{dt} = 0\). These are \(P = 0\), \(P = 1\), and \(P = 3\). The equilibrium solution \(P = 1\) is unstable, while the solutions \(P = 0\) and \(P = 3\) are stable.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5740}{}\hypertarget{p-8975}{}%
If \(P(0) \gt 1\), the population's value will tend to \(P(t) = 3\) as \(t \to \infty\); if \(P(0) \lt 1\), the population's value will tend to \(P(t) = 0\).

We can view \(P(t) = 1\) as the threshold for this population since if there aren't at least \(P(t) = 1\) members of the population, the population cannot grow.

A graph of \(f\) against \(P\) is given in blue in the figure below. This graph and the differential equation show that the equilibrium solutions occur when \(f(P)=0\), or when \(P=0\) or \(P=6\). Since \(P' \lt 0\) for \(P\) slightly less than 0, the solutions with \(P \lt 0\) decrease away from the equilibrium \(P=0\). Also, \(P'>0\) for \(P\) slightly larger than 0 means that the solutions for \(P \gt \) increase away from the equilibrium \(P=0\). So \(P=0\) is an unstable equilibrium. If \(P\) is slightly less than \(6\) we see that \(P \gt 0\), so these solutions increase toward the equilibrium \(P=0\). When \(P\) is slightly larger than \(6\), we have \(P' \lt 0\) and so these solutions decrease toward the equilibrium \(P = 6\). We conclude that the equilibrium solution \(P=6\) is stable.%

Since \(P\) will decrease by \(1\) thousand fish every month through harvesting, the new differential equation is%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dP}{dt} = g(P) = P(6-P)-1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
A sketch of \(g\) against \(P\) is given in green in the figure in (a). The equilibrium solutions now occur when \(g(P) = P(6-P)-1 = 0\). This happens when \(P^2-6P+1 = 0\). The quadratic formula tells us that the solutions to this quadratic equation are%
\begin{equation*}
P = \frac{6+\sqrt{32}}{2} \approx 5.83 \ \ \ \text{ and } \ \ \ P = \frac{6-\sqrt{32}}{2} \approx 0.172\text{.}
\end{equation*}
The same argument as in (a) shows that the equilibrium at \(P\approx 0.172\) is unstable and the equilibrium at \(P \approx 5.83\) is stable.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5754}{}\hypertarget{p-8992}{}%
Assuming that there are fish in the lake, so that \(P > 0\), there are two cases to consider. If \(P \lt \frac{6-\sqrt{32}}{2}\), then \(P' \lt 0\) and the fish population will die out. If \(\frac{6-\sqrt{32}}{2} \lt P \lt \frac{6+\sqrt{32}}{2}\), then \(P' \gt 0\) and the fish population will increase and approach a stable equilibrium population of \(\frac{6+\sqrt{32}}{2}\) thousand fish. If \(P \gt \frac{6+\sqrt{32}}{2}\), then \(P' \lt 0\) and the fish population will decrease and approach a stable equilibrium population of \(\frac{6+\sqrt{32}}{2}\) thousand fish.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5755}{}\hypertarget{p-8993}{}%
In this case the differential equation becomes%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dP}{dt} = g(P) = P(6-P)-h\text{.}
\end{equation*}
We will have equilibrium solutions when \(P^2 - 6P + h = 0\) or when%
\begin{equation*}
P = \frac{6+\sqrt{36-4h}}{2} \ \ \ \text{ and } \ \ \ P = \frac{6-\sqrt{36-4h}}{2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-5756}{}\hypertarget{p-8994}{}%
We need a positive stable equilibrium. This will will happen as long as \(36-4h \ge 0\) or when \(h \le 9\). So the maximum harvest is \(9000\) fish. Note that \(P'\) is negative, so we need to start with more than \(3000\) fish. Since \(P(6-P)\) has a maximum value of \(9\), the fish will reproduce quickly enough so that harvesting \(9000\) fish will maintain a stable population.%

If we let \(y(t)\) be the population of the mice at year \(t\) in thousands and it grows at a yearly rate that is twenty times the number of mice, the governing differential equation is \(\frac{dy}{dt} = 20y\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-5770}{}\hypertarget{p-9011}{}%
On their own, the mice add \(20y\) thousand mice per year to their total population. With \(C\) cats present, the cats now remove \(M(y) = C\frac{y}{2+y}\) thousand mice per year. By taking both the rates at which mice are added and removed from the population into account, we find the updated differential equation%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dt} = 20y - C\frac{y}{2+y}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-5771}{}\hypertarget{p-9012}{}%
For positive \(y\) near \(0\), \(M(y) = \frac{y}{2+y} \approx 0\); for large values of \(y\), \(M(y) = \frac{y}{2+y} \approx 1\). This means that a single cat can remove about \(1\) thousand mice per year from the population when the mice population is large.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5772}{}\hypertarget{p-9013}{}%
Letting \(C=1\), we are working with the differential equation%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dt} = 20y - \frac{y}{2+y}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
To find the equilibrium solutions, we first set \(\frac{dy}{dt} = 0\). Doing so, we find that \(20y = \frac{y}{2+y}\), so \(40y + 20y^2 = y\), or \(39y + 20y^2 = 0\). Factoring, we see \(y(39y + 20) = 0\) and therefore \(y = 0\) or \(y = -\frac{20}{39}\). Since a negative equilibrium solution doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, the only equilibrium solution to study is \(y = 0\). If we plot \(dy/dt\) versus \(y\) for \(y \gt 0\), we see that \(dy/dt\) is always positive, and thus the population will grow away from \(y = 0\), making this equilibrium unstable. And this makes sense:  the population of mice will grow without bound, because one cat is insufficient to keep up with a mice population growing at a rate of \(20\) times its size per year.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5773}{}\hypertarget{p-9014}{}%
Letting \(C=60\), we are working with the differential equation%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dt} = 20y - \frac{60y}{2+y}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Similar work as in (d) shows that the equilibrium solutions are \(y = 0\) or \(y = 1\), and if we plot \(dy/dt\) versus \(y\), we see that for \(0 \lt y \lt 1\), \(dy/dt \lt 0\), while for \(y \gt 1\), \(dt/dt \gt 0\). Thus, with \(60\) cats present, as long as there are initially fewer than \(1000\) mice, the cats will drive the mice population to \(0\). If there are more than \(1000\) mice initially present, the mice population will grow without bound. And if there are \(1000\) mice initially present, this will be an (unstable) equilibrium.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5774}{}\hypertarget{p-9015}{}%
In order to keep the mice population from growing arbitrarily large, we need to bring enough cats that for certain initial mice populations, we can make \(dy/dt \le 0\). In other words, we need enough cats that there's a positive equilibrium solution. Considering the general differential equation,%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dt} = 20y - C\frac{y}{2+y}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
we thus set \(dy/dt = 0\) and solve for \(C\). Doing so, we find that \(0 = 20y - C\frac{y}{2+y}\), so \(20y(y+2) = Cy\) or \(20y^2 + 40y - Cy = 0\). Factoring, we find that%
\begin{equation*}
y(20y + (40-C)) = 0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
To have a positive equilibrium solution, we require that \(40-C \lt 0\), and therefore the farmer must bring at least \(41\) cats to the farm. Even in that circumstance, whether the cats can keep the number of mice from growing without bound will depend on the initial number of mice present.%

In \hyperref[sec-8-2-qualitative]{Section~\ref{sec-8-2-qualitative}}, we saw how a slope field can be used to sketch solutions to a differential equation. In particular, the slope field is a plot of a large collection of tangent lines to a large number of solutions of the differential equation, and we sketch a single solution by simply following these tangent lines.

If we first think about how \(y_1\) is generated for the initial value problem \(\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t) = 2t-1, \ y(0) = 0\), we see that \(y_1 = y_0 + \Delta t \cdot f(t_0)\). Since \(y_0 = 0\), we have \(y_1 = \Delta t \cdot f(t_0)\). From there, we know that \(y_2\) is given by \(y_2 = y_1 + \Delta t f(t_1)\). Substituting our earlier result for \(y_1\), we see that \(y_2 = \Delta t \cdot f(t_0) + \Delta t f(t_1)\). Continuing this process up to \(y_5\), we get%
\begin{equation*}
y_5 = \Delta t \cdot f(t_0) + \Delta t f(t_1) + \Delta t f(t_2) + \Delta t f(t_3) + \Delta t f(t_4)

The exact solution to the initial value problem \(\frac{dy}{dt} = 2t-1, \ y(0) = 0\) is \(y = t^2 - t\), which we find by integrating both sides with respect to \(t\) and then applying the fact that \(y(0) = 0\) to determine that the integration constant is \(0\). From here, we can see that the errors are \(e_1 = y(0.2) - y_1 = 0.04\), \(e_2 = y(0.4) - y_2 = 0.08\), \(e_3 = y(0.6) - y_3 = 0.12\), \(e_4 = y(0.8) - y_4 = 0.16\), \(e_5 = y(1.0) - y_5 = 0.2\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-5798}{}\hypertarget{p-9060}{}%
If we first think about how \(y_1\) is generated for the initial value problem \(\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t) = 2t-1, \ y(0) = 0\), we see that \(y_1 = y_0 + \Delta t \cdot f(t_0)\). Since \(y_0 = 0\), we have \(y_1 = \Delta t \cdot f(t_0)\). From there, we know that \(y_2\) is given by \(y_2 = y_1 + \Delta t f(t_1)\). Substituting our earlier result for \(y_1\), we see that \(y_2 = \Delta t \cdot f(t_0) + \Delta t f(t_1)\). Continuing this process up to \(y_5\), we get%
\begin{equation*}
y_5 = \Delta t \cdot f(t_0) + \Delta t f(t_1) + \Delta t f(t_2) + \Delta t f(t_3) + \Delta t f(t_4)
\end{equation*}
This is precisely the left Riemann sum with five subintervals for the definite integral \(\int_0^1 (2t-1)~dt\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-5799}{}\hypertarget{p-9061}{}%
Since \(\frac{dy}{dt} = 2t-1\), the slope of the tangent line depends only on \(t\). Thus, the different initial condition of \(y(0) = 1\) simply adds \(1\) to every value of \(y_i\) in our computations, which shifts every point we compute by Euler's Method up by 1 unit. This tells us that the solutions to this differential equation all differ by only a constant. We can see that both in our computations with Euler's Method and if we solve the differential equation to get \(y = t^2 - t + C\).%

Since we are approximating the solutions to an initial value problem using tangent lines, we should expect that the error in the approximation will be smaller when the step size is smaller. Consider the initial value problem%

The question posed by this initial value problem is ``what function do we know that is the same as its own derivative and has value 1 when \(t=0\)?'' It is not hard to see that the solution is \(y(t) = e^t\). We now apply Euler's method to approximate \(y(1) = e\) using several values of \(\Delta t\). These approximations will be denoted by \(E_{\Delta t}\), and we'll use them to see how accurate Euler's Method is.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9082}{}%
To begin, we apply Euler's method with a step size of \(\Delta t =
0.2\). In that case, we find that \(y(1) \approx E_{0.2} = 2.4883\). The error is therefore%
\begin{equation*}
y(1) - E_{0.2} = e - 2.4883 \approx 0.2300\text{.}

The behaviors of both cups of coffee are similar in that each decreases toward the room temperature initially and then is driven in an oscillating way by the room temperature function as it rises and falls. We see that Alice's coffee is more susceptible to being influenced away from the average room temperature, which is consistent with her mug being less well insulated, while in Bob's coffee, we see much less radical oscillations (and a slower overall rate of decrease to get near room temperature), which is consistent with being better insulated.%

We have seen that the error in approximating the solution to an initial value problem is proportional to \(\Delta t\). That is, if \(E_{\Delta t}\) is the Euler's method approximation to the solution to an initial value problem at \(\overline{t}\), then%
\begin{equation*}
y(\overline{t})-E_{\Delta t} \approx K\Delta t
\end{equation*}
for some constant of proportionality \(K\).%

Using our earlier results from the initial value problem \(dy/dt = y\) and \(y(0)=1\) with \(\Delta t = 0.2\) and \(\Delta t = 0.1\), we have%
\begin{align*}
y(1) - 2.4883 =\mathstrut \amp  0.2K\\
y(1) - 2.5937 =\mathstrut \amp  0.1K\text{.}

To solve the linear system%
\begin{align*}
y(1) - 2.4883 =\mathstrut \amp  0.2K\\
y(1) - 2.5937 =\mathstrut \amp  0.1K
\end{align*}
we subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \(y(1)\). Doing so, we find that%
\begin{equation*}
-2.4883 - (-2.5937) = 0.2K - 0.1K
\end{equation*}
so that%
\begin{equation*}
0.1054 = 0.1K
\end{equation*}
and thus \(K = 1.054\). Substituting this value into the first equation in the system, it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
y(1) - 2.4883 = 0.2(1.054)
\end{equation*}
so \(y(1) = 0.2(1.054) + 2.4883 = 2.6991\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-5840}{}\hypertarget{p-9118}{}%
Recalling that \(E_{0.05} = 2.6533\) and \(E_{0.025} = 2.6851\), it follows that this data generates the similar linear system given by%
\begin{align*}
y(1) - 2.6533 =\mathstrut \amp  0.05K\\
y(1) - 2.6851 =\mathstrut \amp  0.025K\text{.}
\end{align*}
Solving this system yields \(K = 1.272\) and \(y(1) = 2.7169\). Knowing that the true value of \(y(1)\) is \(e = 2.71828\ldots\), we see that the approximation here in (b) is much better. That is expected because we are already working with better approximations that come from using \(\Delta t = 0.05\) and \(\Delta t = 0.025\), which have been twice halved from the smaller \(\Delta t\) value in (a).%
\item\hypertarget{li-5841}{}\hypertarget{p-9119}{}%
To compute \(E_{0.1}\) and \(E_{0.05}\), we first compute the estimates to \(y(0.3)\) using \(\Delta t = 0.1\) and \(\Delta t = 0.5\). Doing so and making similar assumptions about the error as we did in (a) and (b), we find that for \(\Delta t = 0.1\), \(y(1) \approx 0.0290\) and for \(\Delta t = 0.05\), \(y(1) \approx 0.0351\), and therefore we consider the system%
\begin{align*}
y(0.3) - 0.0290 &= 0.1K\\
y(0.3) - 0.0351 &= 0.05K\text{.}
\end{align*}
Solving the system, it follows that \(K = (-0.0290 + 0.0351)/0.05 = 0.122\) and \(y(0.3) = 0.1(0.122) + 0.0290 = 0.0412\), which is much closer to the actual value of \(y(0.3) = 0.0408\).%

\item[6.]\hypertarget{exercise-528}{}(The Improved Euler's Method)\space\space{}\hypertarget{p-9120}{}%
In this problem, we'll modify Euler's method to obtain better approximations to solutions of initial value problems. This method is called the \emph{Improved Euler's method.}%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9121}{}%
In Euler's method, we walk across an interval of width \(\Delta t\) using the slope obtained from the differential equation at the left endpoint of the interval. Of course, the slope of the solution will most likely change over this interval. We can improve our approximation by trying to incorporate the change in the slope over the interval.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9122}{}%
Let's again consider the initial value problem \(dy/dt = y\) and \(y(0) = 1\), which we will approximate using steps of width \(\Delta t = 0.2\). Our first interval is therefore \(0\leq t \leq 0.2\). At \(t=0\), the differential equation tells us that the slope is 1, and the approximation we obtain from Euler's method is that \(y(0.2)\approx y_1= 1+ 1(0.2)= 1.2\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9123}{}%
This gives us some idea for how the slope has changed over the interval \(0\leq t\leq 0.2\). We know the slope at \(t=0\) is 1, while the slope at \(t=0.2\) is 1.2, trusting in the Euler's method approximation. We will therefore refine our estimate of the initial slope to be the average of these two slopes; that is, we will estimate the slope to be \((1+1.2)/2 = 1.1\). This gives the new approximation \(y(1) = y_1 = 1 + 1.1(0.2) = 1.22\).%

\item\hypertarget{li-5850}{}\hypertarget{p-9136}{}%
We have halved the value of \(\Delta t\) in these two approximations of \(y(1)\) in the Improved Euler Method. Using the notation \(I_{0.2} = 2.7027\) and \(I_{0.1} = 2.7141\) for the estimates generated by the method with the respective \(t\)-values, we see that the following occurs with the error (using the known value of \(y(1) = e\):%
\begin{gather*}
y(1) - I_{0.2} = 2.7183 - 2.7027 = 0.0156\\
y(1) - I_{0.1} = 2.7183 - 2.7141 = 0.0042
\end{gather*}
Computing \(I_{0.05}\), we find \(I_{0.05} = 2.7172\), and thus \(y(1) - I_{0.05} = 0.0011\). Experimenting with powers of \(\Delta t\), it appears that these errors are each approximately \(0.4 \Delta t^2\), and thus the error in the Improved Euler Method seems to be proportional to the square of \(\Delta t\).%

\hypertarget{p-9140}{}%
In \hyperref[sec-8-2-qualitative]{Sections~\ref{sec-8-2-qualitative}} and \hyperref[sec-8-3-euler]{\ref{sec-8-3-euler}}, we have seen several ways to approximate the solution to an initial value problem. Given the frequency with which differential equations arise in the world around us, we would like to have some techniques for finding explicit algebraic solutions of certain initial value problems. In this section, we focus on a particular class of differential equations (called \emph{separable}) and develop a method for finding algebraic formulas for their solutions.%
\begin{assemblage}[Separable differential equations]\label{assemblage-188}
\hypertarget{p-9141}{}%
A first-order \terminology{separable} differential equation is a differential equation of the form%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dt} =  g(y) h(t) \text{.}
\end{equation*}
This structure allows the variables to be separated so that expressions involving \(t \) can be collected on one side, and expressions involving \(y \) can be collected on the other side, multiplied by \(\frac{dy}{dt} \).%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-9142}{}%
For instance, consider the equation%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dt} = ty\text{.}
\end{equation*}
We would like to separate the variables \(t\) and \(y\) so that all occurrences of \(t\) appear on the right-hand side, and all occurrences of \(y\) appear on the left, multiplied by \(dy/dt\). For this example, we divide both sides by \(y\) so that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac1y \frac{dy}{dt} = t\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9143}{}%
Note that when we attempt to separate the variables in a differential equation, we require that one side is a product in which the derivative \(dy/dt\) is one factor and the other factor is solely an expression involving \(y\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9144}{}%
Not every differential equation is separable. For example, if we consider the equation%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dt} = t-y\text{,}
\end{equation*}
it may seem natural to separate it by writing%
\begin{equation*}
y + \frac{dy}{dt} = t\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9145}{}%
As we will see, this will not be helpful, since the left-hand side is not a product of a function of \(y\) with \(\frac{dy}{dt}\).%

\subsection[{Solving separable differential equations}]{Solving separable differential equations}\label{subsection-220}
\index{separable}\hypertarget{p-9157}{}%
Before we discuss a general approach to solving a separable differential equation, it is instructive to consider an example.%
\begin{example}[]\label{Ex-7-4-1}
\hypertarget{p-9158}{}%
Find all functions \(y\) that are solutions to the differential equation%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dt}= \frac{t}{y^2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-488}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-9159}{}%
We begin by separating the variables and writing%
\begin{equation*}
y^2\frac{dy}{dt} = t\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9160}{}%
Integrating both sides of the equation with respect to the independent variable \(t\) shows that%
\begin{equation*}
\int y^2\frac{dy}{dt}~dt = \int t~dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9161}{}%
Next, we notice that the left-hand side allows us to change the variable of antidifferentiation\footnote{This is why we required that the left-hand side be written as a product in which \(dy/dt\) is one of the terms.\label{fn-81}} from \(t\) to \(y\). In particular, \(dy = \frac{dy}{dt}~dt\), so we now have%
\begin{equation*}
\int y^2 ~dy = \int t~dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9162}{}%
This equation says that two families of antiderivatives are equal to each other. Therefore, when we find representative antiderivatives of both sides, we know they must differ by an arbitrary constant \(C\). Antidifferentiating and including the integration constant \(C\) on the right, we find that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{y^3}{3} = \frac{t^2}{2} + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9163}{}%
It is not necessary to include an arbitrary constant on both sides of the equation; we know that \(y^3/3\) and \(t^2/2\) are in the same family of antiderivatives and must therefore differ by a single constant.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9164}{}%
Finally, we solve the last equation above for \(y\) as a function of \(t\), which gives%
\begin{equation*}
y(t) = \sqrt[3]{\frac 32 \, t^2 + 3C}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9165}{}%
Of course, the term \(3C\) on the right-hand side represents 3 times an unknown constant. It is, therefore, still an unknown constant, which we will rewrite as \(C\). We thus conclude that the funtion%
\begin{equation*}
y(t) = \sqrt[3]{\frac 32 \, t^2 + C}
\end{equation*}
is a solution to the original differential equation for any value of \(C\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9166}{}%
Notice that because this solution depends on the arbitrary constant \(C\), we have found an infinite family of solutions. This makes sense because we expect to find a unique solution that corresponds to any given initial value.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9167}{}%
For example, if we want to solve the initial value problem%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{t}{y^2}, \
y(0) = 2\text{,}
\end{equation*}
we know that the solution has the form \(y(t) = \sqrt[3]{\frac32\,
t^2 + C}\) for some constant \(C\). We therefore must find the appropriate value for \(C\) that gives the initial value \(y(0)=2\). Hence,%
\begin{equation*}
2 = y(0) = \sqrt[3]{\frac 32 \, 0^2 + C} = \sqrt[3]{C}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
which shows that \(C = 2^3 = 8\). The solution to the initial value problem is then%
\begin{equation*}
y(t) = \sqrt[3]{\frac32\, t^2+8}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-9168}{}%
The strategy of \hyperref[Ex-7-4-1]{Example~\ref{Ex-7-4-1}} may be applied to any differential equation of the form \(\frac{dy}{dt} = g(y) \cdot h(t)\), and any differential equation of this form is said to be \emph{separable}. We work to solve a separable differential equation by writing%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{g(y)} \frac{dy}{dt} = h(t)\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and then integrating both sides with respect to \(t\). After integrating, we try to solve algebraically for \(y\) in order to write \(y\) as a function of \(t\).%
\begin{example}[]\label{Ex-7-4-2}
\hypertarget{p-9169}{}%
Solve the differential equation%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dt} =3y\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-489}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-9170}{}%
Following the same strategy as in \hyperref[Ex-7-4-1]{Example~\ref{Ex-7-4-1}}, we have%
\begin{equation*}
\frac 1y \frac{dy}{dt} = 3\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9171}{}%
Integrating both sides with respect to \(t\),%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac 1y\frac{dy}{dt}~dt = \int 3~dt\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and thus%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac 1y~dy =  \int 3~dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9172}{}%
Antidifferentiating and including the integration constant, we find that%
\begin{equation*}
\ln|y| = 3t + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9173}{}%
Finally, we need to solve for \(y\). Here, one point deserves careful attention. By the definition of the natural logarithm function, it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
|y| = e^{3t+C} = e^{3t}e^C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9174}{}%
Since \(C\) is an unknown constant, \(e^C\) is as well, though we do know that it is positive (because \(e^x\) is positive for any \(x\)). When we remove the absolute value in order to solve for \(y\), however, this constant may be either positive or negative. To account for a possible \(+\) or \(-\), we denote this updated constant by \(C\) to obtain%
\begin{equation*}
y(t) = Ce^{3t}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-9175}{}%
There is one more technical point to make. Notice that \(y=0\) is an equilibrium solution to this differential equation. In solving the equation above, we begin by dividing both sides by \(y\), which is not allowed if \(y=0\). To be perfectly careful, therefore, we should consider the equilibrium solutions separately. In this case, notice that the final form of our solution captures the equilibrium solution by allowing \(C=0\).%

\item\hypertarget{li-5873}{}\hypertarget{p-9191}{}%
Since the population \(P(t)\) of the town is growing at an annual rate of \(3\%\) per year, this means that \(\frac{dP}{dt} = 0.03 P\)%
\item\hypertarget{li-5874}{}\hypertarget{p-9192}{}%
We use separation of variables and write \(\frac{1}{P} \frac{dP}{dt} = 1.03\). We then have%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{1}{P} \frac{dP}{dt} dt = \int 0.03 dt
\end{equation*}
and thus \(\int \frac{1}{P} dP = \int 0.03 dt\). Evaluating the integrals on each side, we have \(\ln|P| = 0.03 t + c\) By definition of the logarithm function, it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
|P| = e^{0.03t + c} = e^c e^{0.03t} = C e^{0.03t}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Incorporating the \(\pm\) that follows from the abslute value sign into the constant \(C\), we conclude that \(P = Ce^{0.03t}\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-5875}{}\hypertarget{p-9193}{}%
Given that \(P(0) = 10000\), we see that \(10000 = C e^0 = C\). So%
\begin{equation*}
P = 10000 e^{0.03t}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-5876}{}\hypertarget{p-9194}{}%
The population will have doubled when \(P = 200000\). To determine the time it takes the population to double, we solve the equation%
\begin{equation*}
10000 e^{0.03t} = 20000\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Thus \(e^{0.03t} = 2\), so \(t = \frac{\ln(2)}{0.03} \approx 23.105\). It will take about 23.1 years for the population to double in size.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5877}{}\hypertarget{p-9195}{}%
If the annual growth rate is \(k\), then the differential equation for the population is%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dP}{dt} = kP\text{.}
\end{equation*}
We can use separation of variables to show that \(P = P_0 e^{kt}\), where \(P_0\) is the population at time \(t = 0\). We then find the doubling time by solving the equation \(P_0 e^{kt} = 2P_0\). We first solve for \(e^{kt}\) and get \(e^{kt} = 2\). Taking natural logs, \(kt = \ln(2)\), and dividing by \(k\), \(t = \frac{1}{k} \ln(2)\). The doubling time for the population is thus \(\frac{1}{k} \ln(2)\).%

We have%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T - 75)\text{,}
\end{equation*}
where \(k\) is a constant. We also have \(T(0) = 105\). \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-5889}{}\hypertarget{p-9211}{}%
Since the coffee is cooling at a rate of one degree per minute at time \(0\), it follows that \(\frac{dT}{dt} = -1\) at this instant. From the given differential equation, we know \(-k(T(0) - 75) = -1\). Next, \(T(0) = 105\), so \(-k(105 - 75) = -1\), and thus \(k = \frac{1}{30}\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-5890}{}\hypertarget{p-9212}{}%
We use separation of variables to solve the differential equation \(\frac{dT}{dt} = -\frac{1}{30} (T - 75)\). Separating variables and integrating both sides with respect to \(t\),%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{1}{T - 75} dT = -\int \frac{1}{30} dt
\end{equation*}
Integrating both sides,%
\begin{equation*}
\ln \left| T - 75 \right| = -\frac{1}{30} t + c
\end{equation*}
Using the definition of the logarithm function and writing \(e^c = C\), we see that%
\begin{equation*}
|T - 75| = e^{-t/30 + c} = C e^{-t/30}
\end{equation*}
Finally, including the absolute value in \(C\) and solving for \(T\), \(T - 75 = C e^{-t/30}\), so \(T = 75 + Ce^{-t/30}\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-5891}{}\hypertarget{p-9213}{}%
As \(t \to \infty\), \(e^{-t/30} \to 0\). So%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{t \to \infty} \left(75 + Ce^{-t/30} \right) = 75\text{.}
\end{equation*}
This means that as \(t \to \infty\), \(T \to 75\), or the temperature of the coffee tends to 75 degrees.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5892}{}\hypertarget{p-9214}{}%
In order to determine the temperature of the coffee after 20 minutes, we need to first determine the value of the constant \(C\) in the solution \(T = 75 + Ce^{-t/30}\). To do this, we use the fact that the temperature of the coffee at \(t = 0\) is \(105^\circ\)F. Thus, \(105 = 75 + Ce^0\), so \(C = 30\). Now we know that \(T = 75 + 30e^{-t/30}\), and when \(t = 20\), \(T(20) = 75 + 30e^{-2/3}\). The temperature of the coffee after 20 minutes is approximately \(90.4^\circ\)F.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5893}{}\hypertarget{p-9215}{}%
To determine how long it will take the coffee to cool to \(80^\circ\)F, we solve the equation \(80 = 75 + 30 e^{-t/30}\) for \(t\). Solving first for \(e^{-t/30}\), we subtract \(75\) from both sides and divide by \(30\) to get \(e^{-t/30} = \frac{5}{30}\). Taking logarithms and solving for \(t\), \(-\frac{t}{30} = \ln \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)\), and thus \(t = -30 \ln \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)\). We conclude that it will take about 53.75 minutes for the coffee to cool to \(80^\circ\)F.%

We are given that \(\frac{dy}{dt} - (2 - t)y = 2 - t\). We first separate the variables by writing \(\frac{dy}{dt} = (2 - t)y + (2 - t) = (2-t)(y+1)\) and then dividing both sides by \((y+1)\) to find%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{1+y} \frac{dy}{dt} = 2 - t\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Integrating both sides with respect to \(t\), we have%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{1}{1+y} dy = \int (2 - t) dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Evaluating the integrals,%
\begin{equation*}
\ln|1 + y| = \left( 2t - \frac{1}{2}t^2 \right) + c
\end{equation*}
Rewriting without logarithms,%
\begin{equation*}
|1+y| = e^{\left(2t - \frac{t^2}{2} \right)} e^c
\end{equation*}
Writing \(e^c = C\) and including the sign from the absolute value in this constant,%
\begin{equation*}
1 + y = Ce^{\left(2t - \frac{t^2}{2} \right)}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and therefore \(y = -1 + C e^{\left(2t - \frac{t^2}{2} \right)}\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-5906}{}\hypertarget{p-9232}{}%
Given that \(\frac{1}{t} \frac{dy}{dt} = e^{t^2 - 2y}\), we first observe that \(e^{t^2 - 2y} = e^{t^2}e^{ -2y}\). Separating the variables,%
\begin{equation*}
e^{2y} \frac{dy}{dt} = t e^{t^2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Integrating with respect to \(t\),%
\begin{equation*}
\int e^{2y} dy = \int t e^{t^2} dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Using standard substitution techniques on both sides, we find that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{2} e^{2y} = \frac{1}{2} e^{t^2} + c
\end{equation*}
Writing \(2c = C\), we then have \(e^{2y} = e^{t^2} + C\), and taking logarithms to solve for \(y\), we find \(2y = \ln \left( e^{t^2} + C \right)\), and thus%
\begin{equation*}
y = \frac{1}{2} \ln \left( e^{t^2} + C \right)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-5907}{}\hypertarget{p-9233}{}%
For the initial value problem \(y' = 2y + 2\), \(y(0) = 2\), we first solve the differential equation. Noting that \(2y + 2 = 2(y+1)\), we have%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dt} = 2(y + 1)\text{,}
\end{equation*}
so%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{y + 1} \frac{dy}{dt} = 2
\end{equation*}
Integrating with respect to \(t\),%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{1}{y + 1} dy = \int 2 dt
\end{equation*}
and thus evaluating the integrals, \(\ln|y+1| = 2t + c\). It follows that \(|y + 1| = e^{2t + c} = e^c e^{2t}\), so in the usual way we can write \(y+1 = Ce^{2t}\), and therefore%
\begin{equation*}
y = -1 + Ce^{2t}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Using \(y(0) = 2\) to solve the IVP, we obtain \(2 = -1 + Ce^0\) and so \(C = 3\). The solution to the initial value problem is%
\begin{equation*}
y = -1 + 3 e^{2t}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-5908}{}\hypertarget{p-9234}{}%
For the initial value problem \(y' = 2y^2\), \(y(-1) = 2\), we first separate variables and write%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{y^2} \frac{dy}{dt} = 2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Next, integrating with respect to \(t\),%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{1}{y^2} dy = \int 2 dt\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and thus \(-y^{-1} = 2t + c\). Solving for \(y\), it follows%
\begin{equation*}
y = -\frac{1}{2t + c}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
We now use the initial value \(y(-1) = 2\) and obtain \(2 = -\frac{1}{-2 + c}\). Solving for \(c\) gives \(c = \frac{3}{2}\). The solution of the initial value problem is thus%
\begin{equation*}
y = -\frac{1}{2t + \frac{3}{2}} = -\frac{2}{4t + 3}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-5909}{}\hypertarget{p-9235}{}%
For the IVP \(\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{-2ty}{t^2 + 1}\), \(y(0) = 4\), we first separate variables and write%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{y} \frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{-2t}{t^2 + 1}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Integrating with respect to \(t\) we find%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{1}{y} dy = -\int \frac{2t}{t^2 + 1} dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Using the substitution \(u = t^2 + 1\) on the right, it follows that%
\begin{equation*}
\ln|y|  = -\ln\left| t^2 + 1 \right| + c\text{.}
\end{equation*}
By definition and properties of the logarithm,%
\begin{equation*}
|y| = e^{-\ln\left| t^2 + 1 \right|}e^c = e^{\ln\left| t^2 + 1 \right|^{-1}}e^c = \left| t^2 + 1 \right|^{-1} e^c\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Writing \(C = e^c\) and absorbing the absolute value from the left side, we have%
\begin{equation*}
y = \frac{C}{t^2 + 1}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Using the initial condition \(y(0) = 4\), we obtain \(4 = \frac{C}{1}\) or \(C = 4\). Thus, the solution to the initial value problem is%
\begin{equation*}
y = \frac{4}{t^2 + 1}\text{.}
\end{equation*}

A separable differential equation is one that may be rewritten with all occurrences of the dependent variable multiplying the derivative and all occurrences of the independent variable on the other side of the equation.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-9238}{}%
We may find the solutions to certain separable differential equations by separating variables, integrating with respect to \(t\), and ultimately solving the resulting algebraic equation for \(y\).%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-9239}{}%
This technique allows us to solve many important differential equations that arise in the world around us. For instance, questions of growth and decay and Newton's Law of Cooling give rise to separable differential equations. Later, we will learn in \hyperref[sec-8-6-logistic]{Section~\ref{sec-8-6-logistic}} that the important logistic differential equation is also separable.%

Carbon-14 naturally occurs in our environment; any living organism takes in Carbon-14 when it eats and breathes. Upon dying, however, the organism no longer takes in Carbon-14. Suppose that you find remnants of a pre-historic firepit. By analyzing the charred wood in the pit, you determine that the amount of Carbon-14 is only 30\% of the amount in living trees. Estimate the age of the firepit.\footnote{This approach is the basic idea behind radiocarbon dating.\label{fn-82}}%

\item\hypertarget{li-5923}{}\hypertarget{p-9253}{}%
A differential equation that represents the given description is%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dM}{dt} = kM\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-5924}{}\hypertarget{p-9254}{}%
Separating the variables to solve the differential equation yields%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{M} \, dM = k \, dt
\end{equation*}
so%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{1}{M} \, dM = \int k \, dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Integrating and solving for \(M\), we find \(\ln|M| = kt + C\) and thus \(M = e^{kt+C} = e^{kt}e^C = Ke^{kt}\) for some constant \(K\). Using the initial condition \(M(0) = M_0\), it follows that \(K = M_0\). Therefore, the mass at time \(t\) is given by%
\begin{equation*}
M(t) = M_0e^{kt}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-5925}{}\hypertarget{p-9255}{}%
If we let \(5730\) years pass from time \(0\), the remaining mass of the radioactive sample will be \(\frac{1}{2}M_0\). This allows us to find the value of \(k\) by setting \(M(5730)\) equal to \(\frac{1}{2}M_0\) and solving for \(t\). Doing so, we have \(\frac{1}{2}M_0 = M_0e^{5730k}\), and thus \(\frac{1}{2} = e^{5730k}\). It follows that%
\begin{equation*}
\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 5730k
\end{equation*}
from which we find \(k = \frac{1}{5730}\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\frac{\ln(2)}{5730}\). Hence,%
\begin{equation*}
M(t) = M_0e^{-\frac{\ln(2)}{5730}t} \approx M_0e^{-0.000121t}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-5926}{}\hypertarget{p-9256}{}%
Now we want to find the time \(t\) so that \(M(t) = \frac{1}{4}M_0\). Similar work to our recent efforts in (c) shows that \(t = \frac{5730\ln(4)}{\ln(2)} \approx 11460\) years. This number makes sense because it takes \(5730\) years for half of the sample to decay, then another \(5730\) years for half to decay again, for a total of \((2)(5730)\) years for the substance to decay to one quarter of its original amount.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5927}{}\hypertarget{p-9257}{}%
We want to find the time it takes for \(M(t)\) to be \(30\)\% of \(M_0\), so we need to solve \(0.3M_0 = M_0e^{-\frac{\ln(2)}{5730}t}\). Doing so in the usual way, we find that \(t = -\frac{5730\ln(0.3)}{\ln(2)} \approx 9952.8\) years, so we estimate that the sample is about \(9973\) years old.%

Separating the variables, we find that%

y \frac{dy}{dt} = -t
\end{equation*}
and integrating with respect to \(t\)%
\begin{equation*}
\int y \, dy = -\int t \,dt\text{.}

Evaluating the integrals and solving for \(y\), we see that \(\frac{1}{2}y^2 = -\frac{1}{2}t^2 + C\) and therefore%
\begin{equation*}
y^2 = C - t^2\text{,}
\end{equation*}
so \(y = \pm \sqrt{C - t^2}\). Applying the initial condition \(y(0) = 8\), we find that \(8 = \sqrt{C}\) (we choose the \(+\) from \(\pm\) since \(8 \gt 0\)), so \(C = 64\). Hence the solution to the IVP is%

Recall that the differential equation is \(\frac{dy}{dt} = -\frac ty\), and the righthand expression is undefined when \(y = 0\).

\item\hypertarget{li-5954}{}\hypertarget{p-9290}{}%
Since height decreases at \(20\) inches per minute when the water is filled to a depth of \(100\) inches, this tells us that \(\frac{dh}{dt}\vert_{h=100} = -20\). Applying this information to the differential equation,%
\begin{equation*}

\item\hypertarget{li-5969}{}\hypertarget{p-9306}{}%
The only equilibrium solution is \(P = 3\), since \(\ln(1) = 0\) (note: \(\ln(0)\) is undefined, so the differential equation is not defined for \(P = 0\)). From the slope field pictured in (a), the equilibrium solution \(P = 3\) is stable.%
\item\hypertarget{li-5970}{}\hypertarget{p-9307}{}%
To solve the IVP with \(\frac{dP}{dt} = -P\ln\left(\frac P3\right)\) and \(P(0) = 1\), we use separation of variables. Observe that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{P\ln\left(\frac P3\right)}\frac{dP}{dt} = -1
\end{equation*}
and thus%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{1}{P\ln\left(\frac P3\right)} \, dP = - \int 1 \, dt
\end{equation*}
On the left, using the substitution \(u = \ln (P/3)\), it follows \(du = \frac{3}{P} \cdot \frac{1}{3} \, dP\), we can rewrite the most recent equation as%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{du}{u} = - \int 1 \, dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Therefore,%
\begin{equation*}
\ln |u| = -t + C\text{,}
\end{equation*}
so \(|u| = e^{C-t}\), or \(u = Ke^{-t}\). Next, we recall that \(u = \ln \left(\frac P3\right)\), so%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{P}{3} = e^{Ke^{-t}}
\end{equation*}
and \(P = 3e^{Ke^{-t}}\). Applying the initial condition, \(1 = 3e^K\), so \(K = \ln \left(\frac{1}{3} \right)\), and thus%
\begin{equation*}
P(t) = 3e^{\ln \left(\frac{1}{3} \right) e^{-t}}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
This function's plot is shown in blue in the image above in (a) and we see (both graphically and algebraically) that \(P(t) \to 3\) as \(t \to \infty\) since \(e^{-t} \to 0\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-5971}{}\hypertarget{p-9308}{}%
Changing the initial condition to \(P(0) = 6\), we can use all of our preceding work in (c) up to where we established \(P = 3e^{Ke^{-t}}\). Applying this initial condition, \(6 = 3e^K\), so \(K = \ln \left(2 \right)\), and thus%
\begin{equation*}
P(t) = 3e^{\ln \left( 2 \right) e^{-t}}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
This function's plot is shown in red in the image above in (a) and we see (both graphically and algebraically) that \(P(t) \to 3\) as \(t \to \infty\) since \(e^{-t} \to 0\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-5972}{}\hypertarget{p-9309}{}%
Our work in (c) and (d) suggests that regardless of the initial condition with \(P(0) \gt 0\), the long-term behavior of \(P\) will be for it to tend to \(3\) as \(t\) increases without bound. This matches our initial observations based on the slope field.%

How can we use differential equations to describe phenomena in the world around us?%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-9311}{}%
How can we use differential equations to better understand these phenomena?%

\hypertarget{p-9312}{}%
We have seen several ways that differential equations arise in the natural world, from the growth of a population to the temperature of a cup of coffee. In this section, we look more closely at how differential equations give us a natural way to describe various phenoma. As we'll see, the key is to understand the different factors that cause a quantity to change.%
\begin{example}[]\label{PA-7-5}
\hypertarget{p-9313}{}%
Any time that the rate of change of a quantity is related to the amount of a quantity, a differential equation naturally arises. In the following two problems, we see two such scenarios; for each, we want to develop a differential equation whose solution is the quantity of interest. \leavevmode%

\typeout{Subsection 8.5.1 Developing a Differential Equation}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[{Developing a Differential Equation}]{Developing a Differential Equation}\label{subsection-222}
\hypertarget{p-9322}{}%
\hyperref[PA-7-5]{Example~\ref{PA-7-5}} demonstrates the kind of thinking we will be doing in this section. In each of the two examples we considered, there is a quantity, such as the amount of money in the bank account or the amount of salt in the tank, that is changing due to several factors. The governing differential equation states that the total rate of change is the difference between the rate of increase and the rate of decrease.%
\begin{example}[]\label{Ex-7-5-1}
\hypertarget{p-9323}{}%
In the Great Lakes region, rivers flowing into the lakes carry a great deal of pollution in the form of small pieces of plastic averaging 1 millimeter in diameter. In order to understand how the amount of plastic in Lake Michigan is changing, construct a model for how this type pollution has built up in the lake.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-497}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-9324}{}%
First, some basic facts about Lake Michigan. \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-9325}{}%
The volume of the lake is \(5\cdot10^{12}\) cubic meters.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-9326}{}%
Water flows into the lake at a rate of \(5\cdot10^{10}\) cubic meters per year. It flows out of the lake at the same rate.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-9327}{}%
Each cubic meter flowing into the lake contains roughly \(3\cdot10^{-8}\) cubic meters of plastic pollution.%
\end{itemize}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9328}{}%
Let's denote the amount of pollution in the lake by \(P(t)\), where \(P\) is measured in cubic meters of plastic and \(t\) in years. Our goal is to describe the rate of change of this function; so we want to develop a differential equation describing \(P(t)\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9329}{}%
First, we will measure how \(P(t)\) increases due to pollution flowing into the lake. We know that \(5\cdot10^{10}\) cubic meters of water enters the lake every year and each cubic meter of water contains \(3\cdot10^{-8}\) cubic meters of pollution. Therefore, pollution enters the lake at the rate of%
\begin{equation*}
\left(5\cdot 10^{10} \frac{m^3 \text{ water} }{\text{year} }\right) \left(3\cdot10^{-8} \frac{m^3 \text{ plastic} }{m^3 \text{ water} } \right) = 1.5\cdot 10^3
\text{cubic m of plastic per year}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9330}{}%
Second, we will measure how \(P(t)\) decreases due to pollution flowing out of the lake. If the total amount of pollution is \(P\) cubic meters and the volume of Lake Michigan is \(5\cdot 10^{12}\) cubic meters, then the concentration of plastic pollution in Lake Michigan is%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{P}{5\cdot10^{12}}  \text{cubic m of plastic per cubic m of water}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9331}{}%
Since \(5\cdot10^{10}\) cubic meters of water flow out each year\footnote{and we assume that each cubic meter of water that flows out carries with it the plastic pollution it contains\label{fn-83}}, then the plastic pollution leaves the lake at the rate of%
\begin{equation*}
\left(\frac{P}{5\cdot10^{12}} \frac{m^3 \text{ plastic} }{m^3 \text{ water} } \right) \left(5\cdot10^{10} \frac{m^3 \text{ water} }{\text{year} } \right)=\frac{P}{100}
\text{cubic m of plastic per year}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9332}{}%
The total rate of change of \(P\) is thus the difference between the rate at which pollution enters the lake and the rate at which pollution leaves the lake; that is,%
\begin{align*}
\frac{dP}{dt} =\mathstrut \amp  1.5\cdot10^{3}-\frac{P}{100}\\
=\mathstrut \amp  \frac{1}{100}(1.5\cdot10^{5} - P)\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9333}{}%
We have now found a differential equation that describes the rate at which the amount of pollution is changing. To understand the behavior of \(P(t)\), we apply some of the techniques we have recently developed.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9334}{}%
Because the differential equation is autonomous, we can sketch \(dP/dt\) as a function of \(P\) and then construct a slope field, as shown in \hyperref[F-7-5-Ex1-plot]{Figure~\ref{F-7-5-Ex1-plot}} and \hyperref[F-7-5-Ex1-slope-field]{Figure~\ref{F-7-5-Ex1-slope-field}}.%

\par
\hypertarget{p-9335}{}%
These plots both show that \(P=1.5\cdot10^5\) is a stable equilibrium. Therefore, we should expect that the amount of pollution in Lake Michigan will stabilize near \(1.5\cdot10^5\) cubic meters of pollution.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9336}{}%
Next, assuming that there is initially no pollution in the lake, we will solve the initial value problem%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dP}{dt} = \frac{1}{100}(1.5\cdot10^{5} - P), \ P(0) = 0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9337}{}%
Separating variables, we find that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac1{1.5\cdot10^5-P} \frac{dP}{dt} = \frac1{100}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9338}{}%
Integrating with respect to \(t\), we have%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac1{1.5\cdot10^5-P} \frac{dP}{dt}~dt = \int \frac1{100}~dt\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and thus changing variables on the left and antidifferentiating on both sides, we find that%
\begin{align*}
\int \frac{dP}{1.5\cdot10^5-P} =\mathstrut \amp  \int \frac1{100}~dt\\
-\ln|1.5\cdot10^5 - P| =\mathstrut \amp  \frac1{100}t + C
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9339}{}%
Finally, multiplying both sides by \(-1\) and using the definition of the logarithm, we find that%
\begin{equation}
1.5\cdot10^5 - P = C e^{-t/100}\text{.}\label{E-7-5-Ex1C}
\end{equation}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9340}{}%
This is a good time to determine the constant \(C\). Since \(P =
0\) when \(t=0\), we have%
\begin{equation*}
1.5\cdot 10^5 - 0 = Ce^0 = C\text{,}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9341}{}%
so \(C=1.5\cdot10^5\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9342}{}%
Using this value of \(C\) in Equation~\hyperref[E-7-5-Ex1C]{(\ref{E-7-5-Ex1C})} and solving for \(P\), we arrive at the solution%
\begin{equation*}
P(t) = 1.5\cdot10^5(1-e^{-t/100})\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9343}{}%
Superimposing the graph of \(P\) on the slope field we saw in \hyperref[F-7-5-Ex1-slope-field]{Figure~\ref{F-7-5-Ex1-slope-field}}, we see, as shown in \hyperref[F-7-5-Ex1a]{Figure~\ref{F-7-5-Ex1a}}%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9344}{}%
We see that, as expected, the amount of plastic pollution stabilizes around \(1.5\cdot10^5\) cubic meters.%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/7_5_solution.pdf}
\caption{The solution \(P(t)\) and the slope field for the differential equation \(\frac{dP}{dt} = \frac{1}{100}(1.5\cdot10^{5} - P)\).\label{F-7-5-Ex1a}}
\end{figure}
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-9345}{}%
There are many important lessons to learn from \hyperref[Ex-7-5-1]{Example~\ref{Ex-7-5-1}}. Foremost is how we can develop a differential equation by thinking about the ``total rate = rate in - rate out'' model. In addition, we note how we can bring together all of our available understanding (plotting \(\frac{dP}{dt}\) vs. \(P\), creating a slope field, solving the differential equation) to see how the differential equation describes the behavior of a changing quantity.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9346}{}%
We can also explore what happens when certain aspects of the problem change. For instance, let's suppose we are at a time when the plastic pollution entering Lake Michigan has stabilized at \(1.5\cdot10^5\) cubic meters, and that new legislation is passed to prevent this type of pollution entering the lake. So, there is no longer any inflow of plastic pollution to the lake. How does the amount of plastic pollution in Lake Michigan now change? For example, how long does it take for the amount of plastic pollution in the lake to halve?%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9347}{}%
Resetting \(t=0\) at this time, we now have the initial value problem%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dP}{dt} = -\frac{1}{100}P, \ P(0) = 1.5\cdot10^5\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9348}{}%
It is a straightforward and familiar exercise to find that the solution to this equation is \(P(t) = 1.5\cdot10^5
e^{-t/100}\). The time that it takes for half of the pollution to flow out of the lake is given by \(T\) where \(P(T) = 0.75\cdot10^5\). Thus, we must solve the equation%
\begin{equation*}
0.75\cdot10^5 = 1.5\cdot10^5e^{-T/100}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
or%
\begin{equation*}
\frac12 = e^{-T/100}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9349}{}%
It follows that%
\begin{equation*}
T = -100\,\ln\left(\frac12\right) \approx 69.3 \text{years.}
\end{equation*}
%

Equilibrium solutions occur where \(\frac{dA}{dt} = 0\) and so the only equilibriume solution is \(A = 200000\). This means that if you have \textdollar{}200000 in the account, then the amount of money in the account will remain constant at \textdollar{}200000.%
\item\hypertarget{li-6002}{}\hypertarget{p-9372}{}%
Suppose we initially have \textdollar{}100000 in the account. We will solve the intitial value problem%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dA}{dt} = 0.05A - 10000,   A(0) = 100000\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Using separation of variables, we find that%
\begin{equation*}
A = 200000 + C e^{t/20}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and since \(A(0) = 100000\), we have%
\begin{equation*}
A = 200000 - 100000e^{t/20}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
To determine when the account will be depleted, we solve the equation \(A = 0\) for \(t\). Since \(200000 - 100000 e^{t/20} = 0\), it follows \(e^{t/20} = 2\) and thus \(t = 20 \ln(2)\), so the account will be depleted in about 13.86 years.%
\item\hypertarget{li-6003}{}\hypertarget{p-9373}{}%
You must have at least \textdollar{}200000 in the account to make sure the account will never be depleted.%
\item\hypertarget{li-6004}{}\hypertarget{p-9374}{}%
Now suppose the intitial deposit is \textdollar{}300000 and we want to what amount \(w\) we can withdraw every year without depleting the account. So the initial value problem is%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dA}{dt} = 0.05A - w, A(0) = 300000\text{.}
\end{equation*}
The solution to this initial value problem is%
\begin{equation*}
A = 20w + (300000 - 20w) e^{t/20}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
To make sure the account is never depleted, we need \((300000 - 20W)\) to be greater than or equal to 0. Solving the inequality \(300000 - 2w \geq 0\), we obtain \(w \leq 15000\). We can withdraw up to \textdollar{}15000 every year and the account will not be depleted.%

We will use the differential equation \(\frac{dM}{dt} = -kM\), where \(k\) is a positive constant.%
\item\hypertarget{li-6019}{}\hypertarget{p-9393}{}%
With an initial condition of \(M = M_0\) when \(t = 0\), the solution for the initial value problem is%
\begin{equation*}
M = M_0 e^{-kt}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Using a half-life of 2 hours, we see that \(M = \frac{1}{2} M_0\) when \(t = 2\). This gives \(\frac{1}{2}M_0 = M_0 e^{-2k}\), from which it follows that \(k = -\frac{1}{2} \ln \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \approx 0.34657\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-6020}{}\hypertarget{p-9394}{}%
Noting that the rate of change of the drug in the body will be the differnce between the positive contributions of the dosage of 3 milligrams per hour and the decay of \(kM\) per hour, it follows that \(\frac{dM}{dt} = 3 - kM\), where \(k\) is a positive constant.%
\item\hypertarget{li-6021}{}\hypertarget{p-9395}{}%
To find the equilibrium solutions, we solve the equation \(\frac{dM}{dt} = 0\) for \(M\). This gives \(M = \frac{3}{k}\). The graph of \(\frac{dM}{dt}\) as a function of \(M\) is a straight line with a negative slope. (The slope is \(-k\).) So when \(M \lt \frac{3}{k}\), \(\frac{dM}{dt} \gt 0\) and the \(M\) is an increasing function of \(t\). When \(M \gt \frac{3}{k}\), \(\frac{dM}{dt} \lt 0\) and the \(M\) is a decreasing function of \(t\). This means that the equilibrium solution \(mM = \frac{3}{k}\) is a stable equilibrium solution.%
\item\hypertarget{li-6022}{}\hypertarget{p-9396}{}%
We use the initial condition \(M = 0\) when \(t = 0\) and solve the corresponding IVP.  Separating variables,%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{3 - kM} \frac{dM}{dt} = 1\text{,}
\end{equation*}
so%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{1}{3 - kM} dM = \int 1 dt\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and thus%
\begin{equation*}
-\frac{1}{k} \ln |3 - kM | = t + c\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Solving for \(M\) in the usual way gives us%
\begin{equation*}
M = \frac{1}{k} \left( 3 - Ae^{-kt} \right)\text{,}
\end{equation*}
where \(A\) is a constant that arises from the integration constant. Using the initial condition, we obtain \(0 = \frac{1}{k} ( 3 - A)\), so \(A = 3\). Hence, the solution to the initial condition problem is \(M = \frac{1}{k} \left( 3 - 3e^{-kt} \right) = \frac{3}{k} \left( 1 - e^{-kt} \right)\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-6023}{}\hypertarget{p-9397}{}%
We let \(q\) be the unknown intravenous rate of morphine (in milligrams per hour). Notice that if we replace \(3\) with \(q\) in the differential equation and obtain \(\frac{dM}{dt} = q - kM\), the solution process is the same and the equilibriume solution is \(M = \frac{q}{k}\). So if we want the equilibrium solution to be \(M = 7\), we then have \(\frac{q}{k} = 7\), so \(q = 7k \approx 2.426\). The intravenous rate of morphine should be 2.426 milligrams per hour.%

We now know that several important non-polynomials have polynomial-like expansions. For example, for any real number \(x\),%

There are two settings where other series like the one for \(e^x\) arise: we may be given an expression such as%
\begin{equation*}
1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 4x^3 + \cdots
\end{equation*}
and we seek the values of \(x\) for which the expression makes sense. Or we may be trying to find an unknown function \(f\) that has expression%
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \cdots + a_k x^k + \cdots\text{,}

and we try to determine the values of the constants \(a_0\), \(a_1\), \(\ldots\). The latter situation is explored in \hyperref[PA-8-6]{Example~\ref{PA-8-6}}.%

We have learned some of the many important applications of differential equations, and learned some approaches to solve or analyze them. Here, we consider an important approach that will allow us to solve a wider variety of differential equations.%

Let's consider the familiar differential equation from exponential population growth given by%
\begin{equation}
y' = ky\text{,}\label{eq-PA-8-6-Resistance-ode}
\end{equation}
where \(k\) is the constant of proportionality. While we can solve this differential equation using methods we have already learned, we take a different approach now that can be applied to a much larger set of differential equations. For the rest of this example, let's assume that \(k=1\). We will use our knowledge of Taylor series to find a solution to the differential equation \hyperref[eq-PA-8-6-Resistance-ode]{(\ref{eq-PA-8-6-Resistance-ode})}.%

To do so, we assume that we have a solution \(y=f(x)\) and that \(f(x)\) has a Taylor series that can be written in the form%
\begin{equation*}

a_k = \frac{a_0}{k!}\text{.}

\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-9422}{}%
As \hyperref[PA-8-6]{Example~\ref{PA-8-6}} shows, it can be useful to treat an unknown function as if it has a Taylor series, and then determine the coefficients from other information. In other words, we define a function as an infinite series of powers of \(x\) and then determine the coefficients based on something besides a formula for the function. This method allows us to approximate solutions to many different types of differential equations, even if we cannot solve them explicitly. This is different from our work with Taylor series since we are not using an original function \(f\) to generate the coefficients of the series.%

\item\hypertarget{li-6050}{}\hypertarget{p-9439}{}%
Let \(A(t)\) be the amount of money (in millions) in the account at time \(t\). We know that the rate of change of \(A\) is affected by the addition of \(1\) million dollars a year, plus the interest earned, which is \(0.05A\). Thus,%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dA}{dt} = 1 + 0.05A
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-6051}{}\hypertarget{p-9440}{}%
If there is no amount of money in the account when you open it, that means \(A(0) = 0\). Solving the initial value problem, we can find how much money will be in the account after 25 years. Note that \(1 + 0.05A = 0.05(20 + A)\), so we have%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{20+A} \frac{dA}{dt} = 0.05
\end{equation*}
and thus%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{1}{20+A} \, dA = \int 0.05 \, dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Integrating (and noting that \(A(t) > 0\) for all \(t\),%
\begin{equation*}
\ln (20 + A) = 0.05t + C\text{,}
\end{equation*}
so solving for \(A\) in the standard way,%
\begin{equation*}
20 + A = Ke^{0.05t}
\end{equation*}
and thus \(A(t) = Ke^{0.05t} - 20\). Since \(A(0) = 0\), \(K = 20\), and we've shown%
\begin{equation*}
A(t) = 20(e^{0.05t} - 1)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
It follows that \(A(25) = 49.80686\) million dollars.%
\item\hypertarget{li-6052}{}\hypertarget{p-9441}{}%
For this option, we know that \(\frac{dA}{dt} = 0.05A\), \(A(0) = 10\), and thus by the standard solution to this IVP,%
\begin{equation*}
A(t) = 10e^{0.05t}
\end{equation*}
from which we see that \(A(25) = 34.90343\) million dollars.%
\item\hypertarget{li-6053}{}\hypertarget{p-9442}{}%

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-6065}{}\hypertarget{p-9457}{}%
Let the skydiver's downward velocity at time \(t\) be given by \(v(t)\). Since gravity causes her downward velocity to increase at the rate of \(g\approx 9.8\), there is a factor of \(+9.8\) meters per second squared in the differential equation for \(\frac{dv}{dt}\), while the factor of wind resistence causing the velocity to decrease contributes the negative factor \(-kv\). Thus, the differential equation is%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dv}{dt} = 9.8 - kv
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-6066}{}\hypertarget{p-9458}{}%
To find the equilibrium solutions, we set \(\frac{dv}{dt} = 0\) and solve for \(v\). Doing so, \(0 = 9.8 - kv\), so \(v = \frac{9.8}{k}\). Moreover, we note that for \(v \lt \frac{9.8}{k}\), \(\frac{dv}{dt} \gt 0\), while for \(\frac{dv}{dt} \gt \frac{9.8}{k}\), \(\frac{dv}{dt} \lt 0\). Thus, for velocities just above the equilibrium, the velocity will decrease and for velocities just below the equilibrium, the velocity will decrease, making \(v = \frac{9.8}{k}\) a stable equilibrium.%
\item\hypertarget{li-6067}{}\hypertarget{p-9459}{}%
We assume that \(v(0) = 0\) and solve the IVP with the differential equation we developed. Taking the differential equation%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dv}{dt} = 9.8 - kv
\end{equation*}
and separating the variables, we have%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{9.8 - kv} \frac{dv}{dt} = 1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Integrating with respect to \(t\),%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{1}{9.8 - kv} \, dv = \int 1 \, dt\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and using a standard substitution, we have%
\begin{equation*}
-\frac{1}{k} \ln | 9.8 - kv | = t + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Solving for \(v\), we have \(\ln | 9.8 - kv | = -kt + C_1\) (where \(C_1 = -Ck\), or%
\begin{equation*}
|9.8 - kv| = e^{-kt + C_1} = C_2 e^{-kt}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Incorporating the absolute value into the constant \(C_2\) in the usual way, we have for some constant \(A\) that%
\begin{equation*}
9.8 - kv = Ae^{-kt}
\end{equation*}
and thus%
\begin{equation*}
v = \frac{9.8 - Ae^{-kt}}{k}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Setting \(v(0) = 0\), we can also determine \(A\), since then%
\begin{equation*}
0 = \frac{9.8 - A}{k}
\end{equation*}
so \(A = 9.8\). The solution to the IVP is therefore%
\begin{equation*}
v(t) = \frac{9.8 - 9.8e^{-kt}}{k}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-6068}{}\hypertarget{p-9460}{}%
If the skydiver's terminal velocity is 54 meters per second, this means that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{t \to \infty} v(t) = 54
\end{equation*}
Using the solution we found in (c), we observe that%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{9.8 - 9.8e^{-kt}}{k} = \frac{9.8}{k}
\end{equation*}
since \(e^{-kt} \to 0\) as \(t \to \infty\). Thus, \(54 = \frac{9.8}{k}\), so \(k = 9.8/54 \approx 0.181481\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-6069}{}\hypertarget{p-9461}{}%
To find how long does it take to reach 50\% of the terminal velocity, we set \(v(t) = \frac{9.8 - 9.8e^{-0.181481t}}{0.181481} = 0.5(54)\) and solve for \(t\). We have%
\begin{equation*}
9.8 - 9.8e^{-0.181481t} = 0.5(54)(0.181481)\text{,}
\end{equation*}
so%
\begin{equation*}
9.8-9.8e^{-0.181481t} = 4.9\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and thus \(9.8e^{-0.181481t} = 4.9\), which tells us%
\begin{equation*}
e^{-0.181481t} = 0.5\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Solving for \(t\), \(t = \frac{\ln(0.5)}{-0.181481} \approx 3.1894\) seconds.%

\item\hypertarget{li-6076}{}\hypertarget{p-9471}{}%
Since the baby's weight, \(w(t)\) (in pounds at month \(t\)), grows at a rate proportional to its reciprocal, we have%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dw}{dt} = \frac{k}{w}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-6077}{}\hypertarget{p-9472}{}%
Given that \(W(0) = 8\) and \(W(1) = 9\), we can both solve the IVP and determine \(k\). To start, we separate variables and solve the differential equation by writing%
\begin{equation*}
w \frac{dw}{dt} = k
\end{equation*}
and integrating to get%
\begin{equation*}
\int w \frac{dw}{dt} \, dt = \int k \, dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
It follows that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{2}w^2 = kt + C
\end{equation*}
and therefore \(w(t) = \sqrt{2kt + C_1}\) (where \(C_1 = 2C\) and we take the positive square root because we know \(w(t) \gt 0\)). Applying the initial condition \(w(0) = 0\), we find that \(8 = \sqrt{C_1}\), so \(C_1 = 64\) and%
\begin{equation*}
w(t) = \sqrt{2kt + 64}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
To find \(k\), we use the additional information that \(w(1) = 9\), so%
\begin{equation*}
9 = \sqrt{2k + 64}
\end{equation*}
which implies that \(81 = 2k + 64\) and thus \(k = 17/2\). Thus,%
\begin{equation*}
w(t) = \sqrt{7t+64}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
At one year, according to the model the baby weighs \(w(12) = \sqrt{148} \approx 12.17\) pounds.%
\item\hypertarget{li-6078}{}\hypertarget{p-9473}{}%
While the function \(w(t) = \sqrt{7t+64}\) grows without bound as \(t\) increases, the model is unrealistic more because the function initially doesn't grow fast enough. For example, the model predicts that at age \(10\), \(w(120) \approx 30.06\) pounds, and at age \(20\), \(w(120) = 41.76\) pounds. A realistic model would need to grow much more quickly early in life and then level off around age \(20\).%

The volume of solution in the tank remains constant because the inflow and outflow are at the same rate.%
\item\hypertarget{li-6096}{}\hypertarget{p-9495}{}%
Salt enters the tank with the inflow, which occurs at a rate of \(3\) gallons per minute at a concentration of \(20\) grams per gallon. Observing that%

20 \frac{\text{grams}}{\text{gallon}} \cdot 3 \frac{\text{gallons}}{\text{minute}} = 60 \frac{\text{grams}}{\text{minute}}\text{,}

we see that salt is entering the tank at a rate of \(60\) grams per minute.%
\item\hypertarget{li-6097}{}\hypertarget{p-9496}{}%
Letting \(S(t)\) denotes the number of grams of salt in the tank at time \(t\), since there are \(100\) gallons of solution in the tank at any time \(t\), the concentration of salt in the tank in grams per gallon is%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{S(t)}{100} \frac{\text{grams}}{\text{gallon}}
\end{equation*}
at any time \(t\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-6098}{}\hypertarget{p-9497}{}%
With water leaving the tank at \(3\) gallons per minute, it follows that salt is leaving the tank at a rate of%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{S(t)}{100} \frac{\text{grams}}{\text{gallon}} \cdot 3 \frac{\text{gallons}}{\text{minute}} = \frac{3S(t)}{100} \frac{\text{grams}}{\text{minute}}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-6099}{}\hypertarget{p-9498}{}%
Taking into account the rates at which salt enters and leaves the tank as established in (b) and (d) and noting that the units on \(\frac{dS}{dt}\) are grams per minute, we have shown that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dS}{dt} = 60 - \frac{3}{100} S\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-6100}{}\hypertarget{p-9499}{}%
Setting \(60 - \frac{3}{100} S = 0\), we find that \(S = 2000\) is the only equilibrium solution. This makes sense because the inflow is carrying \(20\) grams of salt per gallon and thus when the tank reaches this concentration, there will be \(20 \cdot 100\) total grams of salt. This equilibrium is stable (both intuitively and because \(\frac{dS}{dt}\) is positive for \(S \lt 2000\) and negative for \(S \gt 2000\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-6101}{}\hypertarget{p-9500}{}%
Assuming that \(S(0) = 0\), we can solve the IVP with \(\frac{dS}{dt} = 60 - \frac{3}{100} S\). For somewhat simpler computations, we write \(60 - \frac{3}{100}S = -\frac{3}{100}(S-2000)\). Separating variables,%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{S-2000} \frac{dS}{dt} = -\frac{3}{100}
\end{equation*}
and integrating with respect to \(t\),%
\begin{equation*}
\int  \frac{1}{S-2000} \, dS = -\int \frac{3}{100} \, dt
\end{equation*}
so that%
\begin{equation*}
\ln|S-2000| = -\frac{3}{100}t + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Solving for \(S\) in the usual way,%
\begin{equation*}
S = 2000 + Ke^{-\frac{3}{100}t}
\end{equation*}
and using the initial condition that \(S(0) = 0\), we find \(K = -2000\) so that%
\begin{equation*}
S(t) = 2000 - 2000e^{-\frac{3}{100}t}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-6102}{}\hypertarget{p-9501}{}%
As \(t \to \infty\), we know \(e^{-\frac{3}{100}t} \to 0\), and thus \(S(t) \to 2000\). This makes sense because the inflow carries \(20\) grams of salt per liter continuously. As time goes on, the concentration of solution in the tank should tend to that same concentration, and with \(100\) gallons of solution, the amount of salt will tend to \(20 \cdot 100 = 2000\) grams. This value also matches the stable equilibrium that we found in (f).%

Distributing the \(x\) in the second term on the left yields the desired equation.%

In other words, we can re-index this series by increasing every \(k\) by 2, or replacing \(k-2\) with \(k\), \(k-1\) with \(k+1\) and \(k\) with \(k+2\). This gives us the next desired equation.%

Equation \hyperref[eq-PA-8-6-Airy-sum-3]{(\ref{eq-PA-8-6-Airy-sum-3})} implies that \(a_2 = 0\) and \((k+1)(k+2)a_{k+2}+a_{k-2} = 0\) for all \(k \geq 1\).%

\hypertarget{p-9526}{}%
Solving for \(a_{k+2}\) in the second equation shows that%

These last equations are called \emph{recurrence relations} and allow us to write every coefficient of \(y\) in terms of \(a_0\) and \(a_1\). For example, \(k=1\) shows that \(a_3 = \frac{1}{(2)(3)} a_0 = \frac{1}{6}a_0\). We can continue in this way to obtain the first 10 coefficients in terms of \(a_0\) and \(a_1\):%
\begin{align*}
a_3 \amp = \frac{1}{(2)(3)}a_0\\
a_4 \amp = \frac{1}{(3)(4)}a_1\\
a_5 \amp = \frac{1}{(4)(5)} a_2 = 0\\
a_6 \amp = \frac{1}{(5)(6)} a_3 = \frac{1}{(5)(6)} \left(\frac{1}{(2)(3)} a_0 \right) = \frac{1}{(2)(3)(5)(6)} a_0\\
a_7 \amp = \frac{1}{(6)(7)} a_4 = \frac{1}{(6)(7)} \left(\frac{1}{(3)(4)} a_1 \right) = \frac{1}{(3)(4)(6)(7)} a_1\\
a_8 \amp = \frac{1}{(7)(8)} a_5 = 0\\
a_9 \amp = \frac{1}{(8)(9)} a_6 = \frac{1}{(8)(9)} \left(\frac{1}{(2)(3)(5)(6)} a_0 \right) = \frac{1}{(2)(3)(5)(6)(8)(9)} a_0\\
a_{10} \amp = \frac{1}{(9)(10)} a_7 = \frac{1}{(9)(10)} \left(\frac{1}{(3)(4)(6)(7)} a_1 \right) = \frac{1}{(3)(4)(6)(7)(9)(10)} a_1\text{.}

It may not be obvious, but there is a pattern. %
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-9529}{}%
All of the terms involving \(a_2\) are 0. These terms are \(a_2\), \(a_5\), \(a_8\), etc. The subscripts of these terms are all of the form \(3k+2\). So \(a_{3k+2} = 0\) for every positive integer \(k\).%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-9530}{}%
The terms that involve \(a_0\) have the form \(a_3\), \(a_6\), \(a_{9}\), etc. and are all of the form \(a_{3k}\) for positive integers \(k\). The pattern in the denominators of the coefficient for \(a_{3k}\) is \((2)(3)(5)(6) \cdots (3k-1)(3k)\). So%
\begin{equation*}
a_{3k} = \frac{1}{(2)(3)(5)(6) \cdots (3k-1)(3k)} a_0 \text{ for }  k \geq 1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-9531}{}%
The terms that involve \(a_1\) have the form \(a_4\), \(a_7\), \(a_{10}\), etc. and are all of the form \(a_{3k+1}\) for positive integers \(k\). The pattern in the denominators of the coefficient for \(a_{3k+1}\) is \((3)(4)(6)(7) \cdots (3k)(3k+1)\). So%
\begin{equation*}
a_{3k+1} = \frac{1}{(3)(4)(6)(7) \cdots (3k)(3k+1)} a_1 \text{ for }  k \geq 1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{itemize}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-6122}{}\hypertarget{p-9532}{}%
We can write the solution \(y\) in three pieces as%
\begin{equation*}
y = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} a_kx^k = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_{3k}x^{3k} + \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_{3k+1}x^{3k+1} + \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_{3k+2}x^{3k+2}
\end{equation*}
and so our results from the previous part of this exercise show that%
\begin{align*}
y\amp = a_0\left( 1+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^{3k}}{(2)(3)(5)(6) \cdots (3k-1)(3k)} \right)\\
\amp\phantom{={}}+ a_1 \left( x + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^{3k+1}}{(3)(4)(6)(7) \cdots (3k)(3k+1)} \right)\text{.}

The growth of the earth's population is one of the pressing issues of our time. Will the population continue to grow? Or will it perhaps level off at some point, and if so, when? In this section, we look at two ways in which we may use differential equations to help us address these questions.%

\begin{example}[]\label{act-7-6-1}
\hypertarget{p-9545}{}%
Our first model will be based on the following assumption:%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-19}{}
\hypertarget{p-9546}{}%
\emph{The rate of change of the population is proportional to the population.}%
\end{quote}
\hypertarget{p-9547}{}%
On the face of it, this seems pretty reasonable. When there is a relatively small number of people, there will be fewer births and deaths so the rate of change will be small. When there is a larger number of people, there will be more births and deaths so we expect a larger rate of change.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9548}{}%
If \(P(t)\) is the population \(t\) years after the year 2000, we may express this assumption as%

\hypertarget{p-9567}{}%
We let \(P(t)\) be the population after year 2000 with \(\frac{dP}{dt} = kP\), where \(k\) is a constant of proportionality. \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-6147}{}\hypertarget{p-9568}{}%
Using the data in the table,%
\begin{equation*}
P'(0) \approx \frac{P(1) - P(-1)}{2} \approx \frac{6.159 - 6.008}{2} \approx 0.0755\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-6148}{}\hypertarget{p-9569}{}%
Since \(t = 0\) corresponds to the year \(2000\), \(P(0) = 6.084\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-6149}{}\hypertarget{p-9570}{}%
Using \(\frac{dP}{dt} = kP\) and the preceding values at \(t = 0\), we have \(0.0755 \approx k (6.084)\), so \(k \approx 0.012041\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-6150}{}\hypertarget{p-9571}{}%
The solution for the initial value problem is \(P(t) = 6.084 e^{0.012041t}\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-6151}{}\hypertarget{p-9572}{}%
The year 2010 corresponds to \(t = 10\). So \(P(10) \approx 6.8878\). The model predicts that the population in 2010 will be about 6.888 billion.%
\item\hypertarget{li-6152}{}\hypertarget{p-9573}{}%
The population will be 12 billion when \(P(t) = 12\). So we solve the equation \(6.084e^{0.012041t} = 12\) for \(t\). We see that \(e^{0.012041t} = \frac{12}{6.084}\), so \(t = \frac{1}{0.012041} \ln \left( \frac{12}{6.084}\right) \approx 56.41\). The population will reach 12 billion during the year 2056.%
\item\hypertarget{li-6153}{}\hypertarget{p-9574}{}%
The year 2500 corresponds to \(t = 500\). So \(P(500) \approx 3012.3\). The model predicts that the population in 2500 will be about 3012 billion or about about 3 012 300 000 000. This is rather unreasonably large.%
\end{enumerate}
%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-9575}{}%
Our work in \hyperref[act-7-6-1]{Example~\ref{act-7-6-1}} shows that that the exponential model is fairly accurate for years relatively close to 2000. However, if we go too far into the future, the model predicts increasingly large rates of change, which causes the population to grow arbitrarily large. This does not make much sense since it is unrealistic to expect that the earth would be able to support such a large population.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9576}{}%
The constant \(k\) in the differential equation has an important interpretation. Let's rewrite the differential equation \(\frac{dP}{dt} = kP\) by solving for \(k\), so that we have%
\begin{equation*}
k = \frac{dP/dt}{P}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{assemblage}[Per capita growth rate]\label{assemblage-189}
\hypertarget{p-9577}{}%
The constant \(k\) in the differential equation \(\frac{dP}{dt} = kP\) is called the \terminology{per capita growth rate}. It is the ratio of the rate of change to the population.%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-9578}{}%
In other words, \(k \) is the contribution to the rate of change to the population from a single person.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9579}{}%
In the exponential model we introduced in \hyperref[act-7-6-1]{Example~\ref{act-7-6-1}}, the per capita growth rate is constant. This means that when the population is large, the per capita growth rate is the same as when the population is small. It is natural to think that the per capita growth rate should decrease when the population becomes large, since there will not be enough resources to support so many people. We expect it would be a more realistic model to assume that the per capita growth rate depends on the population \(P\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9580}{}%
In the previous example, we computed the per capita growth rate in a single year by computing \(k\), the quotient of \(\frac{dP}{dt}\) and \(P\) (which we did for \(t = 0\)). If we return to the data in \hyperref[T-7-6-earth]{Table~\ref{T-7-6-earth}} and compute the per capita growth rate over a range of years, we generate the data shown in \hyperref[F-7-6-census]{Figure~\ref{F-7-6-census}}, which shows how the per capita growth rate is a function of the population, \(P\).%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{../../html/Calculus/images/7_6_census.pdf}
\caption{A plot of per capita growth rate vs.~population \(P\).\label{F-7-6-census}}
\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-9581}{}%
From the data, we see that the per capita growth rate appears to decrease as the population increases. In fact, the points seem to lie very close to a line, which is shown at two different scales in \hyperref[F-7-6-census1]{Figure~\ref{F-7-6-census1}}.%

\begin{equation*}
\frac{dP}{dt} = P(0.025 - 0.002P)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9584}{}%
Graphing the dependence of \(dP/dt\) on the population \(P\), we see that this differential equation demonstrates a quadratic relationship between \(\frac{dP}{dt}\) and \(P\), as shown in \hyperref[F-7-6logistic]{Figure~\ref{F-7-6logistic}}.%

\end{figure}
\hypertarget{p-9585}{}%
The equation \(\frac{dP}{dt} = P(0.025 - 0.002P)\) is an example of the \emph{logistic equation}, and is the second model for population growth that we will consider. We expect that it will be more realistic, because the per capita growth rate is a decreasing function of the population.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9586}{}%
Indeed, the graph in \hyperref[F-7-6logistic]{Figure~\ref{F-7-6logistic}} shows that there are two equilibrium solutions, \(P=0\), which is unstable, and \(P=12.5\), which is a stable equilibrium. The graph shows that any solution with \(P(0) \gt 0\) will eventually stabilize around 12.5. Thus, our model predicts the world's population will eventually stabilize around 12.5 billion.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9587}{}%
A prediction for the long-term behavior of the population is a valuable conclusion to draw from our differential equation. We would, however, also like to answer some quantitative questions. For instance, how long will it take to reach a population of 10 billion? To answer this question, we need to find an explicit solution of the equation.%

\index{logistic}\hypertarget{p-9588}{}%
Since we would like to apply the logistic model in more general situations, we state the logistic equation \index{logistic equation} in its more general form.%
\begin{assemblage}[The logistic equation]\label{assemblage-190}
\hypertarget{p-9589}{}%
The \terminology{logistic equation} is%
\begin{equation}
\frac{dP}{dt} = kP(N-P)\text{.}\label{E-7-6-logistic}
\end{equation}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9590}{}%
The equilibrium solutions  are \(P=0\) and \(1-\frac PN = 0\), which shows that \(P=N\). The equilibrium at \(P=N\) is called the \terminology{carrying capacity} \index{carrying capacity} of the population for it represents the stable population that can be sustained by the environment.%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-9591}{}%
We now solve the logistic equation~\hyperref[E-7-6-logistic]{(\ref{E-7-6-logistic})}. The equation is separable, so we separate the variables%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{P(N-P)}\frac{dP}{dt} = k\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and integrate to find that%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac{1}{P(N-P)}~dP = \int k~dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9592}{}%
To find the antiderivative on the left, we use the partial fraction decomposition%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{P(N-P)} = \frac 1N\left[\frac 1P + \frac 1{N-P}\right]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9593}{}%
Now we are ready to integrate, with%
\begin{equation*}
\int \frac 1N\left[\frac 1P + \frac 1{N-P}\right] ~dP  =  \int k~dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9594}{}%
On the left, observe that \(N\) is constant, so we can remove a factor of \(\frac{1}{N}\) and antidifferentiate to find that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac 1N (\ln|P| - \ln|N-P|)  =  kt + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9595}{}%
Multiplying both sides of this last equation by \(N\) and using a rule of logarithms, we next find that%
\begin{equation*}
\ln\left|\frac{P}{N-P}\right| = kNt + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9596}{}%
From the definition of the logarithm, replacing \(e^C\) with \(C\), and letting \(C\) absorb the absolute value signs, we now know that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{P}{N-P} =  Ce^{kNt}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9597}{}%
At this point, all that remains is to determine \(C\) and solve algebraically for \(P\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9598}{}%
If the initial population is \(P(0) = P_0\), then it follows that \(C = \frac{P_0}{N-P_0}\), so%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{P}{N-P} = \frac{P_0}{N-P_0}e^{kNt}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9599}{}%
We will solve this equation for \(P\) by multiplying both sides by \((N-P)(N-P_0)\) to obtain%
\begin{align*}
P(N-P_0) &=  P_0(N-P)e^{kNt}\\
&=  P_0Ne^{kNt} - P_0Pe^{kNt}\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9600}{}%
Solving for \(P_0Ne^{kNt}\), expanding, and factoring, it follows that%
\begin{align*}
P_0Ne^{kNt} &=  P(N-P_0) + P_0 Pe^{kNt}\\
&=  P(N-P_0 + P_0e^{kNt})\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9601}{}%
Dividing to solve for \(P\), we see that%
\begin{equation*}
P = \frac{P_0Ne^{kNt}}{N-P_0 + P_0e^{kNt}}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9602}{}%
Finally, we choose to multiply the numerator and denominator by \(\frac{1}{P_0}e^{-kNt}\) to obtain%
\begin{equation*}
P(t) = \frac{N}{\left(\frac{N-P_0}{P_0}\right) e^{-kNt} + 1}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9603}{}%
While that was a lot of algebra, notice the result: we have found an explicit solution to the logistic equation.%
\begin{assemblage}[Solution to the Logistic Equation]\label{assemblage-191}
\hypertarget{p-9604}{}%
The solution to the initial value problem%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dP}{dt} = kP(N-P), \ P(0) = P_0\text{,}
\end{equation*}
\index{logistic equation!solution} is%
\begin{equation}
P(t) = \frac{N}{\left(\frac{N-P_0}{P_0}\right) e^{-kNt} + 1}\text{.}\label{E-7-6-logistic-solution}
\end{equation}
%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-9605}{}%
For the logistic equation describing the earth's population that we worked with earlier in this section, we have%
\begin{equation*}
k=0.002,  N= 12.5, \ \text{and} \  P_0 = 6.084\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9606}{}%
This gives the solution%
\begin{equation*}
P(t) = \frac{12.5}{1.0546e^{-0.025t} + 1}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
whose graph is shown in \hyperref[F-7-6-logistic-sol]{Figure~\ref{F-7-6-logistic-sol}}.%

\hypertarget{p-9607}{}%
The graph shows the population leveling off at 12.5 billion, as we expected, and that the population will be around 10 billion in the year 2050. These results, which we have found using a relatively simple mathematical model, agree fairly well with predictions made using a much more sophisticated model developed by the United Nations.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-9608}{}%
The logistic equation is good for modeling any situation in which limited growth is possible. For instance, it could model the spread of a flu virus through a population contained on a cruise ship, the rate at which a rumor spreads within a small town, or the behavior of an animal population on an island. Through our work in this section, we have completely solved the logistic equation, regardless of the values of the constants \(N\), \(k\), and \(P_0\). Anytime we encounter a logistic equation, we can apply the formula we found in Equation~\hyperref[E-7-6-logistic-solution]{(\ref{E-7-6-logistic-solution})}.%

Consider the logistic equation \(\frac{dP}{dt} = kP(N - P)\). \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-6165}{}\hypertarget{p-9625}{}%
The maximum value for \(\frac{dP}{dt}\) will occur when \(P = \frac{N}{2}\) since this is the highest point on the graph.%
\item\hypertarget{li-6166}{}\hypertarget{p-9626}{}%
The model we created for the population of the earth was \(\frac{dP}{dt} = P(0.025 - 0.002P\), which can be rewritten as \(\frac{dP}{dt} = 0.002P(12.5 - P)\). So for this model, the maximum rate of change for the earth's population will occur when the population is 6.125 billion. This value is slightly less than the earth's population in recent years.%
\item\hypertarget{li-6167}{}\hypertarget{p-9627}{}%
So for the logistic model, we have \(k = 0.002\), \(N = 12.5\). Using the year 2000 as \(t = 0\), the initial population is 6.084. So the solution for the differential equation in part (b) is%
\begin{equation*}
P = \frac{12.5}{1.0546e^{-0.025t} + 1}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
For the year 2100, we use \(t = 100\) and this model predicts that in the year 2100, the earth's population will be 11.504 billion.%
\item\hypertarget{li-6168}{}\hypertarget{p-9628}{}%
To determine when this model predicts that the earth's population will be 9 billion, we solve the  equation%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{12.5}{1.0546e^{-0.025t} + 1} = 9
\end{equation*}
for \(t\). Multiplying both sides by \(\left( 1.0546e^{-0.025t} + 1 \right)\), we have%
\begin{equation*}
12.5 = 9 \left( 1.0546e^{-0.025t} + 1 \right)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Dividing by \(9\) then subtracting \(1\) from both sides, \(1.0546e^{-0.025t} = \left( \frac{12.5}{9} - 1 \right)\). Thus, \(e^{-0.025t} = \frac{\left( \frac{12.5}{9} - 1 \right)}{1.0546}\). Using logarithms in the usual way, \(t = \frac{1}{-0.025} \ln \left( \frac{\left( \frac{12.5}{9} - 1 \right)}{1.0546}\right) \approx 39.9049\). The earth's population will reach 9 billion in about 2040.%
\item\hypertarget{li-6169}{}\hypertarget{p-9629}{}%
The solution for the general logistic initial value problem is%
\begin{equation*}
P(t) = \frac{N}{\left( \frac{N - P_0}{P_0} \right) e^{-kNt} + 1}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
For this solution, we see that%
\begin{align*}
P(0) \amp = \frac{N}{\left( \frac{N - P_0}{P_0} \right) + 1}\\
\amp = \frac{N}{\frac{N - P_0 + P_0}{P_0}}\\
\amp = \frac{N P_0}{N}\\
\amp = P_0
\end{align*}
To determine \(\lim_{t \to \infty} P(t)\), we first note that since \(-kN \lt  0\), \(\lim_{t \to \infty} e^{-kNt} = 0\). Hence,%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{t \to \infty}\left[ \left( \frac{N - P_0}{P_0} \right)e^{-kNt} + 1 \right] = 1\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and therefore,%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{t \to \infty} P(t) = \lim_{t\to \infty} \frac{N}{\left( \frac{N - P_0}{P_0} \right) e^{-kNt} + 1} = \frac{N}{1} = N\text{.}

The equilibrium solutions for this logistic equation are \(p = 0\) and \(p = 1\). Since \(p = 1\) is the carrying capacity and thus a stable equilibrium, \(p(t) \to 1\) as \(t \to \infty\) provided \(p(0) \gt 0\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-6181}{}\hypertarget{p-9645}{}%

\begin{equation*}
P(t) = \frac{N}{\left(\frac{N-P_0}{P_0}\right) e^{-kNt} + 1}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
In the context of this problem, we know that \(k = 0.2\), \(N = 1\), and \(p(0) = 0.1\) and therefore the solution is%
\begin{equation*}
p(t) = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1-0.1}{0.1}\right) e^{-0.2t} + 1} = \frac{1}{9e^{-0.2t} + 1}\text{.}

%
\item\hypertarget{li-6182}{}\hypertarget{p-9646}{}%
We know that \(p\) is changing most rapidly when its derivative, \(p'\), is largest. Recalling the original differential equation, we know that%
\begin{equation*}
p' = 0.2p(1-p)
\end{equation*}
which shows that \(p'\) is a quadratic function of \(p\). That quadratic function has zeros at \(p = 0\) and \(p = 1\), so the vertex of this concave down quadratic function lies at \(p = \frac{1}{2}\), and at this value of \(p\) the rate of change of \(p\) is largest. Thus, we solve the equation \(p(t) = 0.5\) to find the time at which the population is increasing fastest. We see that%
\begin{equation*}
0.5 = \frac{1}{9e^{-0.2t} + 1}
\end{equation*}
so%
\begin{equation*}
9e^{-0.2t} + 1 = 2

so%
\begin{equation*}
9e^{-0.2t} + 1 = 1.2

Let \(y\) be the per capita growth rate as a function of \(b\). Using the given data in the problem statement, we know that this linear function passes through the points \((6000,3)\) and \((9000,2)\). The equation of this line is thus%
\begin{equation*}
y - 3 = -\frac{1}{3000}(b - 6000)
\end{equation*}
so \(y = (3 + 2) - \frac{1}{3000}b = 5 - \frac{1}{3000}b\). Since the logistic equation comes from taking the product of the population at time \(t\) with its per capita growth rate at that time, we find that%

\frac{db}{dt} = b \left( 5 - \frac{1}{3000}b \right) = \frac{1}{3000} b(15000 - b)

%
\item\hypertarget{li-6193}{}\hypertarget{p-9660}{}%
From the form of the logistic equation, we see that the carrying capacity for the bacteria is \(b = 15000\), which is a stable equilibrium for the population.%
\item\hypertarget{li-6194}{}\hypertarget{p-9661}{}%
The bacteria is increasing most rapidly when \(\frac{db}{dt}\) is greatest. Since%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{db}{dt} = \frac{1}{3000} b(15000 - b)
\end{equation*}
is a quadratic function of \(b\), \(\frac{db}{dt}\) is maximized at the vertex of this concave down parabola, which occurs halfway between its zeros: \(b = 0\) and \(b = 15000\). Thus, when \(b = 7500\), the population is growing fastest. To find the exact \(t\)-value when this occurs, we'd need to know an initial condition like in the next part of the problem.%
\item\hypertarget{li-6195}{}\hypertarget{p-9662}{}%
Using \(b(0) = 1000\), we solve the logistic equation IVP with%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{db}{dt} = \frac{1}{3000} b(15000 - b)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Using \(N = 15000\), \(k = \frac{1}{3000}\), and \(b_0 = 1000\), we know from the standard form of the solution to the logistic equation that%
\begin{equation*}
b(t) = \frac{15000}{\left(\frac{15000-1000}{1000}\right) e^{-5t} + 1} = \frac{15000}{14e^{-5t} + 1}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
To find how long it takes the bacteria to reach 80\% of the carrying capacity, we solve the equation%
\begin{equation*}
0.8 \cdot 15 = \frac{15000}{14e^{-5t} + 1}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
That equation implies that%
\begin{equation*}
0.8 = \frac{1}{14e^{-5t} + 1}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
so \(14e^{-5t} + 1 = 1.2\) and thus \(e^{-5t} = 0.2/14 = 1/70\). It follows that \(t = -\frac{1}{5} \ln(1/70) \approx 0.8497\) days.%

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-6206}{}\hypertarget{p-9676}{}%
From the form of the given logistic equation, we can see the carrying capacity is 10000 fish.%
\item\hypertarget{li-6207}{}\hypertarget{p-9677}{}%
In this situation, the initial condition is \(P(0) = 10\), and by removing \(20\)\% of the population per year, we subtract \(0.2P\) from the rate that defines the differential equation, thus finding%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dP}{dt} = 0.1P(10 - P) - 0.2P\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-6208}{}\hypertarget{p-9678}{}%
Expanding and rewriting the differential equation in (b), we see that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dP}{dt} = P - 0.1P^2 - 0.2P = 0.8P - 0.1P^2 = 0.1P(8 - P)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
This, too, is a logistic equation, with carrying capacity \(8000\) fish.%
\item\hypertarget{li-6209}{}\hypertarget{p-9679}{}%
We can solve this logistic equation in the usual way (keeping in mind the initial condition \(P(0) = 10\), and noting that the carrying capacity is \(8\)):%
\begin{equation*}
P(t) = \frac{8}{\frac{8-10}{10}e^{-0.1 \cdot 8 t}+1} = \frac{8}{-0.2e^{-0.8t}+1}
\end{equation*}
After one year, the population of fish will thus be%
\begin{equation*}
P(1) \approx 8.7899
\end{equation*}
thousand fish.%
\item\hypertarget{li-6210}{}\hypertarget{p-9680}{}%
To be within 10\% of the carrying capacity, we need \(0.9(8) \le P(t) \le 1.1(8)\). Since the initial condition is larger than the carrying capacity, we want to know when \(P(t) = 1.1(8) = 8.8\). Thus we solve the equation%
\begin{equation*}
8.8 = \frac{8}{-0.2e^{-0.8t}+1}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
which implies \(-0.2e^{-0.8t}+1 = 8/8.8 = 10/11\). Thus, \(e^{-0.8t} = 5/11\), so \(t = -1.2 \ln(5/11) \approx 0.9461\) years.%
