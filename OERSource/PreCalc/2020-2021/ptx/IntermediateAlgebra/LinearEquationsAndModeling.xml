<section xml:id="appendix-Linear-Equations-and-Inequalities"><title>Linear Equations</title>
<introduction>
<p>In the previous chapter, we explored algebraic expressions. In this section, we will introduce a new type of mathematical statement known as <term>equations</term>. In particular, we will look at <term>linear equations</term> and how to solve them.</p>

<assemblage><title>In this section, you will...</title>

        <li><p>define <term>equations</term> and what it means for an equation to be <term>linear</term></p></li>

<p>An <term>equation</term> is a mathematical statement that two expressions are equal, such as <m>3x-12=0</m>. A <term>solution</term> to an equation is any set of values that can replace the variables to produce a true statement. The variable in the equation <m>3x-12=0</m> is <m>x</m> and the solution is <m>x=4</m>. To verify this, substitute the value 4 in for <m>x</m> and check that you get a true statement:</p>

<md>
    <mrow>3x-12 \amp =0</mrow>
    <mrow>3(\alert{4})-12 \amp=0</mrow>
    <mrow>12-12\amp =0</mrow>
    <mrow>0\amp =0 \ \checkmark</mrow>
</md>

<p>In this chapter, we are particularly interested in <term>linear</term>, or first-degree, equations. Linear equations are equations that can be written so that every term is either a constant or a constant times a single variable with no exponent. For example,</p>

<me>y=-5,\: \: \: y=4x,\: \: \: 2x+4=13,\: \: \: y=14-2x,\: \: \: y=13x+9-3x</me>

<p>There are a few things worth noticing among these examples. First, notice that the last equation above is linear, even though it is not in its simplified form. All the terms <m>13x, 9, -3x</m> are either constants or constants times the variable <m>x</m>. If we simplify the equation, we have <m>y=10x+9</m>, and again, the terms <m>10x</m> and <m>9</m> are a constant times the variable and a constant, satisfying the conditions for a linear equation. Second, a linear equation can have one variable or many: <m>y=-5</m> is a linear equation in one variable, while <m>y=4x</m> is a linear equation in two variables.</p>

<p>Some examples of equations that are NOT linear are:</p>


<me>y=x^3,\: \: \:  y=-4x^2+3,\: \: \:  y=3x-17+5x^3,\: \: \:  y=\sqrt{x-4},\: \: \:  y=\frac{1}{x}+2, \: \: \: y=2x^x</me>
</introduction>


<subsection><title>Solving Linear Equations</title>

<p>To solve an equation we can generate simpler equations that have the same solutions. Equations that have identical solutions are called <term>equivalent equations</term>. For example,
    <me>3x - 5 = x + 3</me>
and
    <me>2x = 8</me>
are equivalent equations because the solution of each equation is <m>4</m>. Often we can find simpler equivalent equations by undoing in reverse order the operations performed on the variable.</p>

<p>By the end of this section, we will consider linear equations in more than one variable, but we will first focus on solving linear equations in a single variable.</p>

<p>The following list provides important rules for solving linear equations.</p>

<assemblage><title>To Generate Equivalent Equations</title>
<p><ol label="1">
    <li><p>We can add or subtract the <em>same</em> number on <em>both</em> sides of an equation.</p></li>
    <li><p>We can multiply or divide <em>both</em> sides of an equation by the <em>same</em> number (except zero).</p></li>
</ol></p>
</assemblage>

<p>Applying either of these rules produces a new equation equivalent to the old one and thus preserves the solution. We use the rules to isolate the variable on one side of the equation.</p>

<example>
    <statement>
        <p>Solve the equation <m>3x - 5 = x + 3</m>.</p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
        <p>We first collect all the variable terms on one side of the equation, and the constant terms on the other side.
        <md>

                3x - 5 \alert{{}- x} \amp = x + 3 \alert{{}- x}\amp\amp \text{Subtract }x \text{ from both sides.}
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
                2x - 5 \amp = 3\amp\amp \text{Simplify.}
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
                2x - 5 \alert{{}+ 5} \amp = 3 \alert{{}+ 5}\amp\amp \text{Add 5 to both sides.}
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
                2x \amp = 8 \amp\amp\text{Simplify.}
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
                \frac{2x}{\alert{2}}\amp =\frac{8}{\alert{2}}\amp\amp\text{Divide both sides by 2.}
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
                x\amp = 4\amp\amp\text{Simplify.}
            </mrow>
            </md>
        The solution is <m>4</m>. (You can check the solution by substituting <m>4</m> into the original equation to show that you get a true statement as the result.)</p>
    </solution>
    </example>

<p>The following steps should enable you to solve any linear equation. Of course, you may not need all the steps for a particular equation.</p>

<assemblage><title>To Solve a Linear Equation</title>

    <ol label="1"> 
        <li><p>Simplify each side of the equation separately.
        <ol label="a">
            <li><p>Apply the distributive law to remove parentheses.</p></li>
            <li><p>Combine like terms.</p></li>
        </ol></p></li>
        <li><p>By adding appropriate terms to both sides of the equation or subtracting appropriate terms from both sides of the equation, get all the variable terms on one side and all the constant terms on the other.</p></li>
        <li><p>Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable.</p></li>
    </ol>
</p>
</assemblage>

<example>
<statement>
    <p>Solve <m>3(2x - 5) - 4x = 2x - (6 - 3x)</m>.</p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>We begin by simplifying each side of the equation.
    <md>
        <mrow>
            3(2x - 5) - 4x \amp = 2x - (6 - 3x) \amp\amp\text{Apply the distributive law.}

        </mrow>
        <mrow>
            2x - 15 \amp= 5x - 6
        </mrow>
    </md>
    Next, we collect all the variable terms on the left side of the equation, and all the constant terms on the right side.
    <md>
        <mrow>
            2x - 15 \alert{- 5x} \amp= 5x - 6 \alert{- 5x} \amp\amp\text{Subtract }5x \text{ from both sides.}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
            -3x - 15 \alert{+ 15} \amp= - 6 \alert{+ 15} \amp\amp\text{Add } 15 \text{ to both sides.}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
            -3x \amp= 9
        </mrow>
    </md>
    Finally, we divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable.
    <md>
        <mrow>
            -3x \amp= 9 \amp\amp\text{Divide both sides by }-3.
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
            x \amp =-3
        </mrow>
    </md>
    The solution is <m>-3</m>.</p>
</solution>
</example>

<p>We will often come across the need to solve linear equations with fraction or decimal coefficients. In this case, we can "clear" the denominators by multiplying both sides of the equation by the least common multiple of the denominators, as shown in the following example.</p>

<example>
<statement>
    <p>Solve <m>\frac{p-2}{3}+\frac{p}{4}=\frac{1}{2}</m>.</p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>We begin by finding the least common multiple of the three denominators: LCM<m>(3,4,2)=12</m>. Then we multiply both sides of the equation by <m>12</m>, and continue solving as normal.
    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        \frac{p-2}{3}+\frac{p}{4}\amp =\frac{1}{2}\\
        (\alert{12})\left(\frac{p-2}{3}+\frac{p}{4}\right)\amp =(\alert{12})\frac{1}{2}\\
        \frac{12(p-2)}{3}+\frac{12p}{4}\amp =\frac{12}{2}\\
        4(p-2)+3p\amp =6\\
        4p-8+3p\amp =6\\
        7p-8\amp = 6\\
        7p\amp =14\\
        p\amp =2
        \end{aligned}
    </me>
    The solution is <m>p=2</m>.</p>
</solution>
</example>

<p>When we have decimal coefficients, it is sometimes easier to multiply through by <m>10,100</m>, etc. before solving the equation.</p>
<example>
<statement>
    <p>Solve <m>0.04x+0.08x=-0.1+0.17x</m>.</p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>As always, our first step is to combine like terms.
    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        0.04x+0.08x \amp= -0.1+0.17x \\
        0.12x \amp= -0.1+0.17x
        \end{aligned}
    </me>
    Since the decimal coefficients have up to <m>2</m> decimal places, we will multiply each side of the equation by <m>100</m> before solving the equation.
    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
            0.12x \amp =-0.1+0.17x\\
            (\alert{100})(0.12x) \amp =(\alert{100})(-0.1+0.17x)\\
            2x\amp =-10+17x\\
            -5x\amp =-10\\
            x\amp =2
        \end{aligned}
    </me>
    The solution is <m>x=2</m>.</p>
</solution>

<subsection><title>Number of Solutions to Linear Equations of One Variable.</title>
<p>
Not all linear equations have one solution. Although all of the examples above of linear equations with one variable have one solution, there are two other possible scenarios. Firstly, an equation of one variable which has equivalent expressions on both sides of the equals sign has infinitely many solutions. For example,
<me>3x-2 = 3x-2, \hspace{1cm} x=x, \hspace{.5cm}\text{and}\hspace{.5cm} 2(x+1) = 2x+2 </me>
all have infinitely many solutions. In this situation, any values we substitute for the variables will result in a true statement. Secondly, an equation which has two expressions that are not equal for any values of the variables has no solution. For example,
<me> 7x+2 = 7x+10, \hspace{1cm} 17 = 0, \hspace{.5cm}\text{and}\hspace{.5cm} 2(8x+3) = 16x -5 </me>
all have no solutions. Here, no matter what values we substitute for the variables we will receive a false statement.
</p>
<p>
The number of solutions to a linear equation may not be immediately obvious. To determine the number of solutions, follow the procedures above for solving a linear equation. If at any point we have a statement which we recognize as always true or always false, then we know the equation has infinitely many or zero solutions, respectively. Else, we will finish solving the equation to determine the single solution.
</p>

  <example><statement>
      <p>
Solve each equation. Determine whether there is one solution, infinitely many solutions, or no solutions.

<subsection><title>Linear Equations and Formulas with Multiple Variables</title>

<p>Up to this point, we have only solved linear equations in one variable. Sometimes we will encounter a linear equation in more than one variable; although we cannot necessarily find an explicit solution, it may be helpful to solve such equations for particular variables.</p>

<example>
<statement>
    <p>Solve the equation <m>y=3(x+8)</m> for <m>x</m>.</p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>To solve for <m>x</m>, we can use the same processes as before: we first simplify both sides, and then isolate <m>x</m>.</p>
    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
            y \amp= 3(x+8) \amp\amp\text{Apply the distributive property.} \\
            y \amp= 3x+24 \amp\amp\text{Subtract 24 from both sides.} \\
            y-24 \amp= 3x\amp\amp\text{Divide by 3.} \\
            \dfrac{y-24}{3} \amp= x
        \end{aligned}
    </me>
</solution>
</example>

<p>Solving an equation for a given variable is particularly helpful when dealing with formulas. A <term>formula</term> is an equation that reflects a real-world situation. For example, <me>P = 2L + 2W</me> gives the perimeter of a rectangle in terms of its length and width.</p>
    
<image source="images/perimeter-rectangle.png" width="45%"></image>


<p>Suppose we have some wire fence to enclose an exercise area for rabbits, and we would like to see what dimensions are possible for different rectangles with that perimeter. In this case, it would be more useful to have a formula for the length of the rectangle in terms of its perimeter and its width. We can find such a formula by solving the perimeter formula for <m>L</m> in terms of <m>P</m> and <m>W</m>.
<md>
    <mrow>
        2L + 2W \amp= P \amp\amp\text{Subtract }2W \text{ from both sides}
    </mrow>
    <mrow>
        2L \amp= P - 2W \amp\amp\text{Divide both sides by 2}
    </mrow>
    <mrow>
        L \amp= \frac{P - 2W}{2}
    </mrow>
</md>
The result is a new formula that gives the length of a rectangle in terms of its perimeter and its width.</p>
    
<example>
<statement>
    <p>Solve <m>3x - 5y = 40</m> for <m>y</m> in terms of <m>x</m>.</p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>We isolate <m>y</m> on one side of the equation.</p>
    <md>
        <mrow>
            3x - 5y \amp = 40\amp\amp\text{Subtract }3x \text{ from both sides.}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
                    -5y \amp = 40 - 3x\amp\amp\text{Divide both sides by }-5.
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
                    \frac{-5y}{-5} \amp = \frac{40 - 3x}{-5}\amp\amp\text{Simplify both sides.}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
                    y \amp = -8 + \frac{3}{5}x
        </mrow>
    </md>
</solution>
</example>
    
<p>There are many real world applications for which we can use formulas. One such useful formula is that which relates Fahrenheit to Celsius.</p>
    
<example>
<statement>
    <p>The formula <m>5F = 9C + 160</m> relates the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, <m>F</m>, to the temperature in degrees Celsius, <m>C</m>. Solve the formula for <m>C</m> in terms of <m>F</m>.</p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>We begin by isolating the term that contains <m>C</m>.</p>
    <md>
        <mrow>
            5F \amp= 9C + 160 \amp\amp\text{Subtract 160 from both sides.}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
            5F - 160 \amp = 9C \amp\amp\text{Divide both sides by 9.}
        </mrow>
        <mrow>
            \frac{5F - 160}{9} \amp =C
        </mrow>
    </md>
    <p>We can also write the formula for <m>C</m> in terms of <m>F</m> as <m>C = \dfrac{5}{9}F - \dfrac{160}{9}</m>.</p>
</solution>
</example>

<p>Formulas can be found in a multitude of subjects. One especially useful everyday application is that of percents. For example, simple interest <m>I</m> is given by the formula <m>I=prt</m> where <m>p</m> represents the principal amount invested at an annual interest rate <m>r</m> (as a decimal, not a percent) for <m>t</m> years.</p>

<example>
<statement>
    <p>Calculate the simple interest earned on a <m>2</m>-year investment of $<m>1250</m> at an annual interest rate of <m>3.75</m>.</p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>We must convert <m>3.75</m>% to a  decimal number before using it in the formula: <me>r=3.75\text{%}=0.0375</me> We also know that <m>p=$1235</m> and <m>t=2</m>, so</p>
    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        I\amp=prt \\ \amp=(\alert{1250})(\alert{0.0375})(\alert{2}) \\ \amp= 93.75
        \end{aligned}
    </me>
    <p>The simple interest earned is <m>$93.75</m>.</p>
</solution>

<p>If an inequality has one or more variables in it, a <term>solution</term> of that inequality is any set of values that can replace the variables to produce a true statement. For example, <m>3</m> is a solution for <m>2x>2</m> since <m>2\cdot3>2</m> is a true statement. However, <m>3</m> is not the only solution! In fact, any number greater than <m>1</m> is a solution. While linear equations have exactly one, zero, or infinitely many solutions, linear inequalities can have much more complex solution sets.</p>

<p>Solving linear inequalities is very similar to solving linear equalities. The main difference is in multiplying and dividing: if we multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the direction of the inequality must be reversed. For example, if we multiply both sides of the inequality <me>2\lt 5</me> by <m>-3</m>, we get

    </mrow>
    <mrow>
        -6 \amp\gt -15.
    </mrow>
</md>
Because of this property, the rules for solving linear equations must be revised slightly for solving linear inequalities.</p>

    <li><p>We may add the same number to both sides of an inequality or subtract the same number from both sides of an inequality without changing its solutions.</p></li>
    <li><p>We may multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a <em>positive</em> number.</p></li>
    <li><p>If we multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a <em>negative</em> number, we must <em>reverse the direction of the inequality symbol</em>.</p></li>

<subsection><title>Interval Notation</title>
<p>A common way to represent solutions of an inequality is with <term>interval notation</term>. An interval is a set that consists of all the real numbers between two numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.</p>

<p>The set <m>-2 \le x \le 2</m> includes its endpoints <m>-2</m> and <m>2</m>, so we call it a <term>closed interval</term><idx>closed interval</idx>, and we denote it by <m>[-2, 2]</m> (see <xref ref="fig-numline-closed-vs-open" text="type-global"/>a). The square brackets tell us that the endpoints are included in the interval. An interval that does not include its endpoints, such as <m>-2 \lt x \lt 2</m>, is called an <term>open interval</term><idx>open interval</idx>, and we denote it with round brackets, <m>(-2, 2)</m> (see <xref ref="fig-numline-closed-vs-open" text="type-global"/>b).</p>

 <figure xml:id="fig-numline-closed-vs-open">
    <caption></caption><image source="images/fig-numline-closed-vs-open.svg"><description>closed interval and open interval</description></image>
</figure>

<warning>
    <p>Do not confuse the open interval <m>(-2, 2)</m> with the point <m>(-2, 2)</m>! The notation is the same, so you must decide from the context whether an interval or a point is being discussed.</p>
</warning>

<p>We can also discuss <term>infinite intervals</term><idx>infinite intervals</idx>, such as <m>x\lt 3</m> and <m>x\ge -1</m>, shown in <xref ref="fig-numline-infinite-intervals" text="type-global"/>. We denote the interval <m>x\lt 3</m> by <m>(-\infty, 3)</m>, and the interval <m>x\ge -1</m> by <m>[-1, \infty)</m>. The symbol <m>\infty</m>, for infinity, does not represent a specific real number but rather indicates that the interval continues forever along the real line. We always use round brackets next to <m>\pm\infty</m> in infinite intervals.</p>

<figure xml:id="fig-numline-infinite-intervals">
    <caption></caption><image source="images/fig-numline-infinite-intervals.svg"  width="70%"><description>infinite intervals</description></image>
</figure>

<p>Finally, we can combine two or more intervals into a larger set. For example, the set consisting of <m>x\lt -1</m> or <m>x\gt 2</m>, shown in <xref ref="fig-numline-disjoint-infinite-intervals" text="type-global"/>, is the <term>union</term><idx>union</idx> of two intervals and is denoted by <m>(-\infty,-2) \cup (2,\infty)</m>.</p>

<p>Many solutions of inequalities are intervals or unions of intervals.</p>

    <p>Write each of the solution sets with interval notation and graph the solution set on a number line.

<section  xml:id="Applications-Linear-Equations"><title>Applications of Linear Equations</title>
<introduction>
<p>Algebra simplifies the process of solving real-world problems. This is done by using letters to represent unknowns, restating problems in the form of equations, and by offering systematic techniques for solving those equations. In this section, we will solve several types of real world problems using algebra.</p>

        <li><p>write and solve linear equations to represent real world applicastions</p></li>
    </ul>
</p>
</assemblage>

<p>To solve problems using algebra, first translate the wording of the problem into mathematical statements that describe the relationships between the given information and the unknowns. Usually, this translation to mathematical statements is the difficult step in the process. The key to the translation is to carefully read the problem and identify certain key words and phrases.</p>

<p>When translating sentences into mathematical statements, be sure to read the sentence several times and parse out the key words and phrases. It is important to first identify what needs to be represented by a variable, and then specify what that variable will be. For instance, if we are solving a word problem that asks us to find the distance that a car travelled, we likely will want to define a variable to represent the distance the car travelled. It is important to be specific and include units if applicable: it is better to say "<m>d=</m>the distance travelled by the car in miles" than simply saying "<m>d=</m>distance".</p>

<p>In the previous paragraph, we chose the variable <m>d</m> to represent distance. You can choose any letter for your variables, but it can be helpful to chose a letter that aligns with what the variable represents (such as <m>d</m> for distance, <m>t</m> for time, etc.). However, we often just use <m>x</m>. As long as you clearly define your variables, it does not matter what variables you use.</p>

<p>Before we work with word problems, we will first practice translating simple sentences into equations.</p>

<example>
<statement>
    <p>
        Write an equation for the sequence of operations to describe each situation below.
        <ol label="a">
            <li><p><m>x</m> is <m>9</m> more than <m>y</m>.</p></li>
            <li><p>Half of <m>x</m> is <m>y</m>.</p></li>
            <li><p><m>x</m> is <m>30%</m> of <m>y</m>.</p></li>
        </ol>
    </p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>In all of these examples, it can be helpful to think of the word "is" as the equals sign.
        <ol label="a">
            <li><p><m>x</m> is <m>9</m> more than <m>y</m> means that <m>x=y+9</m>.</p></li>
            <li><p>Half of <m>x</m> is <m>y</m> means that <m>\frac{1}{2}x=y</m>.</p></li>
            <li><p><m>x</m> is <m>30%</m> of <m>y</m> means that <m>x=0.30y</m>.</p></li>
        </ol>
    </p>
</solution>
</example>

<p>We will now expand these ideas to solve a word problem using a linear equation.</p>

<example>
<statement>
    <p>
        When 6 is subtracted from twice the sum of a number and 8, the result is 5. Find the number.
    </p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>
        Let <m>n</m> represent the unknown number. In the sentence above, "the sum of a number and 8" is represented by <m>n+8</m>, so "twice the sum of a number and 8" is <m>2(n+8)</m>. Next, "6 subtracted from twice the sum of a number and 8" would be 6 less than this, so it is <m>2(n+8)-6</m>. Finally, we are told that the result is 5; in other words, this expressions is equal to 5:
        <me>
            2\cdot (n+8)-6=5
        </me>
        Now that we have translated the problem into a linear equation, we can solve for <m>n</m>:
        <me>
        \begin{aligned}
            2(n+8)-6 \amp = 5\\
            2n+16-6\amp = 5\\
            2n+10\amp =5\\
            2n\amp = -5\\
            n\amp = -\frac{5}{2}
        \end{aligned}
        </me>
        We should always check our answer to be sure that we didn't make a mistake in setting up or solving the problem. The sum of <m>-\frac{5}{2}</m> and <m>8</m> is <m>-\frac{5}{2}+8=\frac{11}{2}</m>. Twice this is <m>\frac{11}{2}\cdot2=11</m>, and <m>6</m> less than this is <m>5</m>. Since we got the desired result, we know that our answer is correct. The unknown numbers is <m>-\frac{5}{2}</m>.
        </p>
</solution>

<p> General guidelines for setting up and solving word problems follow:</p>

<assemblage><title>Guidelines for Word Problems</title><idx>word problems</idx>
<p>
    <ol label="1">
        <li>
            Read the problem several times, identify the key words and phrases, and organize the given information.
        </li>
        <li>
            Identify the variables by assigning a letter or expression to the unknown quantities.
        </li>
        <li>
            Translate and set up an algebraic equation that models the problem.

            Solve the resulting algebraic equation.
        </li>

<p>All of the equations in the following examples can be set up using only one variable. We can avoid two variables by looking for a relationship between the unknowns. </p>

<example>
<statement>
    <p>A rectangle has a perimeter measuring <m>92</m> meters. The length is <m>2</m> meters less than <m>3</m> times the width. Find the dimensions of the rectangle.</p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>The sentence "The length is <m>2</m> meters less than <m>3</m> times the width" gives us the relationship between the two important quantities, the length and the width. Let <m>w</m> represent the width of the rectangle. Since the length is <m>2</m> meters less than <m>3</m> times the width, the length must be <m>3w-2</m>.</p>
    <p>The sentence "A rectangle has a perimeter measuring <m>92</m> meters" suggests an algebraic set up. The perimeter of a rectangle is always the sum of twice the length and twice the width; in this example, this means that the perimeter is <me>2w+2(3w-2)</me> Since we know that the perimeter is <m>92</m> meters, we have the following equation:</p>
        <me>92=2w+2(3w-2)</me>
    <p>Once you have set up an algebraic equation with one variable, solve for the width, <m>w</m>.</p>

    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        92\amp =2w+2(3w-2) \amp \text{Distribute}\\
        92\amp =2w+6w-4 \amp\text{Combine like terms}\\
        92\amp =8w-4 \amp\text{Solve for }w\\
        96\amp =8w\\
        12\amp =w\\
        \end{aligned}
    </me>

    <p>Now that we know the width, we can use the fact that the lenfth is <m>3w-2</m> to find the length.</p>

    <me>3w-2=3(\alert{12})-2=36-2=34</me>

    <p>This means that the dimensions of the rectangle are <m>12</m> meters by <m>34</m> meters. To check, we make sure the perimeter is actually <m>92</m> meters:</p>

    <me>2(12)+2(34)=24+68=92</me>

</solution>
</example>

<p>For the rest of this section, we will explore several different categories of application problems that you might see, such as applications of interest, currency, distances, and more. </p>

<subsection><title>Interest Applications</title>

<p>In problems involving simple interest, it is often helpful to use the simple interest formula <m>I=prt</m> where <m>I</m> is the simple interest earned on a principle investment, <m>p</m>, with an interest rate of <m>r</m> over <m>t</m> years.</p>

    <p>Next, substitute all of the known quantities into the formula and then solve for the only unknown, <m>t</m>.</p>

        I\amp = prt\\

        437.50\amp = 109.375t\\
        \frac{437.50}{109.375}\amp = \frac{109.375t}{109.375}\\
        4\amp = t

<solution>
    <p> The sum of the money in each account is <m>$12,500</m>. When a total is involved, a common technique used to avoid two variables is to represent the second unknown as the difference of the total and the first unknown.</p>

<subsection><title>Currency Applications</title>
<p> A new kind of problem we come across in applications is something we call currency problems. These problems involve finding the number of coins or bills given other information about value. It is important to be careful in defining our variables specifically - either for the number of currency or the value of the currency.</p>
    

<example>
<statement>
    <p>Ashley has $17.25 in her piggy bank, which has only quarters and fifty-cent pieces in it.  Ashley has nine more fifty-cent pieces than she has quarters. How many coins of each denomination does she have?</p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>Let <m>q</m> represent the number of quarters. Since Ashley has nine more fifty-cent pieces than quarters, the number of fifty cent pieces she has is <m>q+9</m>.</p>

    <p>Since a quarter is worth <m>$0.25</m>, <m>0.25q</m> represents the value of Ashley's quarters. Similarly, since a fifty-cent piece is worth <m>$0.50</m>, <m>0.50(q+9)</m> gives the value of Ashley's fifty-cent pieces.</p>

    <p>Since Ashley has a total of <m>$17.25</m>, it must be the case that the sum of these values is <m>17.25</m>: <me>0.25q+0.50(q+9)=17.25</me> We can now solve for <m>q</m>:
    
    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        0.25q+0.50(q+9) \amp= 17.25 \\
        0.25q+0.50q+4.50 \amp= 17.25 \\
        0.75q+4.50 \amp= 17.25 \\
        0.75q \amp= 12.75 \\
        q \amp= 17
        \end{aligned}
    </me>
    
    Ashley has <m>17</m> quarters, andtherefore <m>26</m> fifty-cent pieces.</p>
</solution>

<warning>
<p>A common mistake in currency problems is to translate nickels being worth 5 cents to their value being <m>.5</m>. As a decimal, nickels are worth <m>.05</m>!</p>

<subsection><title>Mixing Applications</title>

<p>Mixture problems often include a percentage and some total amount. It is important to make a distinction between these two types of quantities. For example, if a problem states that a 10-ounce container is filled with a <m>3</m>% saline (salt) solution, then this means that the container is filled with a mixture of salt and water as follows:</p>

<sidebyside><tabular top="major" halign="center" right="minor" left="minor" bottom="minor">
    <row bottom="minor">
        <cell><m></m></cell>
        <cell><m>Percentage</m></cell>
        <cell><m>Amount</m></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
        <cell><m>Salt</m></cell>
        <cell><m>3</m>%<m>=0.03</m></cell>
        <cell><m>0.03</m> (<m>10</m> ounces)<m>=0.3</m> ounces</cell>
    </row>
    <row>
        <cell><m>Water</m></cell>
        <cell><m>97</m>%<m>=0.96</m></cell>
        <cell><m>0.96</m> (<m>10</m> ounces)<m>=9.7</m> ounces</cell>
    </row>
</tabular></sidebyside>

<p>In other words, we multiply the percentage times the total to get the amount of each part of the mixture.</p>

<example>
<statement>
    <p>How many milliliters of a <m>15</m>% alcohol solution must be mixed with <m>110</m> milliliters of a <m>35</m>% solution to obtain a <m>25</m>% solution?</p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>It is often helpful to use a table to organize your work for application problems. We will use the following table to keep track of all the different solutions in this problem:</p>

    <sidebyside><tabular top="major" halign="center" right="minor" left="minor" bottom="minor">

        <cell></cell>
        <cell></cell>
        <cell></cell>
    </row>
    </tabular></sidebyside>

    <p>Let <m>m</m> be the milliliters of the <m>15</m>% solution. To get the amount of alcohol in this part of the mixture, we multiply the percentage by the amount: <m>0.15m</m>.</p>

    <p>Likewise, to get the amount of the second part of the mixture, we multiply the percentage by the amount: <m>0.35\cdot 110=38.5</m>.</p>

    <p>Let's now think about the mixture of these two solutions. We know that we're aiming for a <m>25</m>% solution. Since there are <m>m</m> milliliters from the first solution and <m>110</m> milliliters from the second solution, the mixture will have <m>m+110</m> milliters in it. Again, we find the amount of alcohol in the mixture by multiplying the percentage by the amount: <m>0.25(m+110)</m>. We can now fill in our table.</p>

    </tabular></sidebyside>

    <p>From our table, we see that the total amount of alochol in the mixture is <m>0.25(m+110)</m>. On the other hand, we know that there are <m>0.15m</m> milliliters from the first solution and <m>38.5</m> milliliters from the second solution, for a total of <m>0.15m+38.5</m> milliliters of alcohol in the solution. We have found two different expressions for the total amount of alcohol in the mixuture, so they must be equal:</p>

    <me>0.15m+38.5 = 0.25(m+110)</me>

    <p>We can now solve for <m>m</m>.</p>

    <me>\begin{aligned}
        0.15m+38.5\amp = 0.25(m+110)\\
        0.15m +38.5 \amp =0.25m+27.5\\
        38.5\amp = 0.10m+27.5\\
        11\amp =0.10m\\
        110\amp =m
        \end{aligned}

    <p>We have found that we must mix <m>110</m> milliliters of a <m>15</m>% alcohol solution with <m>110</m> milliliters of a <m>35</m>% solution to obtain a <m>25</m>% solution.</p>

<subsection><title>Distance Applications</title>

<p>The distance traveled is equal to the average rate times the time traveled at that rate, <m>d=r\cdot t</m>. These problems usually have a lot of data, so it helps to carefully rewrite the pertinent information as you define variables.</p>


<example>
<statement>
    <p>Two planes leave a city traveling in opposite directions. One travels at a rate of <m>530</m> mph and the other at a rate of <m>600</m> mph. How long will it take until they are <m>3672.5</m> miles apart?</p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>Let <m>d_1</m> represent the distance travelled by the first plane in miles, and let <m>d_1</m> represent the distance travelled by the second plane in miles. The key to this problem is that the sum of their distances is the distance between them:</p>

    <image source="images/planes-distance.png" width="75%"><description>Quadrants of the Plane</description></image>

    <p>Let <m>t</m> represent the time it takes for them to be <m>3672.5</m> miles apart (in hours); this is what we're actually looking for. The first plane travels at a rate of <m>530</m> mph, meaning that its distance is modeled by the equation
        <me> d_1=r\cdot t= 530 t</me>
    The second plane travels at a rate of <m>600</m> mph, meaning that its distance is modeled by the equation
        <me> d_2=r\cdot t= 600 t</me>
    Since the sum of their distances is the distance between them, after <m>t</m> hours the two planes will be 
        <me>d_1+d_2=530t+600t=1130t</me>
    miles apart. Now, we want to know when the distance is <m>3672.5</m>. Thus we solve:
        <me>\begin{aligned}
            3672.5\amp =1130t\\
            3.25\amp =t
            \end{aligned}
        </me>
    This tells us that it will take <m>3</m> hours and <m>15</m> minutes for the planes to be <m>3672.5</m> miles apart.</p>

<section  xml:id="Relations-Tables-Graphs"><title>Relations, Tables, and Graphs</title>
<introduction>
<p>Mathematics is often concerned with how different mathematical objects are related to one another. For example, consider the equation <m>y=x+1</m>. Since <m>x=3</m>, <m>y=4</m> is a solution to this equation, one might say that <m>x=3</m> is related to <m>y=4</m>. In this section, we will define a mathematical <term>relation</term> and explore different ways that relations can be represented.</p>

<assemblage><title>In this section, you will...</title>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>define <term>relations</term></p></li>
        <li><p>represent relations with ordered pairs, tables, arrow diagrams, and graphs</p></li>
        <li><p>identify the <term>domain</term> and <term>rangle</term> of a relation from its different representations</p></li>
    </ul>
    </p>
</assemblage>
</introduction>

<subsection><title>Relations and their Representations</title>

<p>A <term>relation</term> is a collection of pairs of objects from two sets. Often, the objects are numbers that have been paired together in a particular way. In the context of algebra, the relations of interest are sets of <term>ordered pairs</term> <m>(x,y)</m> that are related by an algebraic equation. We call the first entry in the ordered pair the <term><m>x</m>-coordinate</term>, and the second entry the <term><m>y</m>-coordinate</term>.</p>

<p>For example, using the rule <m>y=x+1</m>, <m>x=3</m> is related to <m>y=4</m>. We would simply write that <m>(3,4)</m> is a part of this relation. Some other ordered pairs in this relation are <m>(5,6)</m>, <m>(-4,-3)</m>, and <m>(1.52,2.52)</m>.</p>

<warning><p>In the example above, the pair <m>(4,3)</m> is NOT in this relation. Ordered pairs look like <m>(x,y)</m> with the <m>x</m>-coordinate appearing first.</p></warning>

<p>If we wanted to list several ordered pairs of a relation, we could simply list them. The following is an example of a relation:
    <me>\big\{(4,6), \ (2,1), \ (0,4), \ (5,5), \ (-1,4)\big\}</me>
</p>

<note><p>The brackets "<m>\{ \ \}</m>" are used to indicate a list of mathematical objects. In this course, you will see brackets used to indicate a set of ordered pairs for a relation, as well as sets of numbers.</p></note>

<p>Two ways that we can represent a relation that are more organized than a list of ordered pairs are with tables and arrow diagrams. The table and arrow diagram for this relation are shown below.</p>

<image source="images/relations-arrows.png"><description>Arrow Diagram</description></image></sidebyside>

<p>Arrow diagrams are less common than the other representations in this section, but are particularly useful when talking about functions, which will be discussed in Chapter 4.</p>

<p>The last (and perhaps most important) representation of a relation that we will discuss is a graph. For relations between sets of numers, graphs are a visual way to represent the relationship between the numbers on a coordinate plane. The rectangular coordinate system consists of two real number lines that intersect at a right angle. The horizontal number line is often referred to as the <term><m>x</m>-axis</term>, and the vertical number line is often  referred to as the <term><m>y</m>-axis</term>. These two number lines define a flat surface called a <term>plane</term>. The intersection of the two axes is known as the <term>origin</term>, which corresponds to the point <m>(0, 0)</m>.</p>

<p>The <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-axes break the plane into four regions called <term>quadrants</term>, named using Roman numerals I, II, III, and IV, as pictured. The ordered pair <m>(x, y)</m> represents the position of points relative to the origin. For example, the ordered pair <m>(-4, 3)</m> represents the position <m>4</m> units to the left of the origin, and <m>3</m> units above in the second quadrant.</p>

<image source="images/Quadrants.png"><description>Quadrants of the Plane</description></image>

<p>Returning to our previous example, the relation would be represented by the following graph:</p>

<sidebyside width="65%"><image source="images/relations-graph.png"><description>Graph of a Relation</description></image></sidebyside>

<p>Let's explore another relation: consider the absolute value, denoted <m>|x|</m>. The absolute value takes an input <m>x</m> and tells us its distance from zero. For instance, <m>|5|=5</m>, <m>|-7|=7</m>, and <m>|-112|=112</m>. Now let's consider the algebraic equations <m>y=|x|-2</m> and <m>x=|y|+1</m>. Both these equations define relations between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> involving the absolute values. The tables below show some of the ordered pairs for each of these relations.</p>

<image source="images/SolutionsAbsValue.png"><description>Solutions to Absolute Value Equations</description></image>


<p>As ordered pairs, we can list these solutions as well.</p>

<small>
<md>
    <mrow>
        y\amp=|x|-2\text{ has solutions }{(-3,1),(-2,0),(-1,-1),(0,-2),(1,-1),(2,0),(3,1)}
    </mrow>
    <mrow>
        x\amp =|y|+1\text{ has solutions }{(4,-3),(3,-2),(2,-1),(1,0),(2,1),(3,2),(4,3)}
    </mrow>
</md>
</small>

<p>We can visually display any relation of this type on a coordinate plane by plotting the points, or ordered pairs.</p>

<image source="images/AbsValue1.png"><description>Absolute Value Graphs</description></image>

<p>The solution sets of each equation will form a relation consisting of infinitely many ordered pairs. We can use the given ordered pair solutions to estimate all of the other ordered pairs by drawing a line through the given points. Here we put an arrow on the ends of our lines to indicate that this set of ordered pairs continues without bounds.</p>

<image source="images/AbsValue2.png"><description>Absolute Value Graphs</description></image>

</subsection>

 <subsection><title>Domain and Range</title>

<p>The set consisting of all of the first components of a relation, in this case the <m>x</m>-values, is called the <term>domain</term>. And the set consisting of all second components of a relation, in this case the <m>y</m>-values, is called the <term>range</term> (or codomain). Often, we can determine the domain and range of a relation if we are given its graph.</p>

    <image source="images/AbsValue3.png"><description>Absolute Value Graphs</description></image>

<p>Here we can see that the graph of <m>y=|x|-2</m> has a domain consisting of all real numbers, <m>\mathbb{R}=(-\infty,\infty)</m>, and a range of all <m>y</m>-values greater than or equal to <m>-2</m>, <m>[-2,\infty)</m>. The domain of the graph of <m>x=|y|+1</m> consists of all <m>x</m>-values greater than or equal to <m>1</m>, <m>[1,\infty)</m>, and the range consists of all real numbers, <m>\mathbb{R}=(-\infty,\infty)</m>.</p>

<example>
<statement>
    <p>Determine the domain and range of the following relation.

        <image source="images/DomainRange1.png"><description>Vertical Line Test</description></image>
    </p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>The minimum <m>x</m>-value represented on the graph is <m>-8</m> and all others are larger. Therefore the domain consists of all <m>x</m>-values in the interval <m>[-8,\infty)</m>. The minimum <m>y</m>-value represented on the graph is <m>0</m> so the range is <m>[0,\infty)</m>.
        <image source="images/DomainRange2.png"><description>Vertical Line Test</description></image>
    The domain is given by <m>[-8,\infty)</m> and the range is <m>[0,\infty)</m>.</p>
</solution>
</example>

<example>
<statement>
    <p>Determine the domain and range of the following relation.

        <me>
            \big\{(4,6), \ (2,5), \ (3,6), \ (0,0)\big\}
        </me>
    </p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>The domain is the set of first components of a relation; for this relation, the first components are
        <me>\{4, \ 2, \ 3, \ 0\}</me>
    The range is the set of the second components, which are
        <me>\{6, \ 5, \ 0\}</me>
    Notice that <m>6</m> was a second component twice. This is allowed, but we only need to list it in the range once.</p>
</solution>
</example>

<note><p>The domain and range of a relation do not indicate which components are related to one another, so the order that we list elements of the domain and range does not matter.</p></note>

<p>Notice that several of the ordered pairs in our table have decimal-valued coordinates. If you are randomly selecting values of <m>x</m>, this will often happen and is okay. However, if you are plotting these points by hand and cannot accurately plot decimal-valued points, you should avoid using these points. In the table above, we found two points with integer coordinates: <m>(0,4)</m> and <m>(2,5)</m>. These two points are enough to graph this equation. We can then verify that all of the decimal-valued coordinates do in fact fall on this line.</p>

<subsection><title>Intercepts of Graphs of Linear Equations</title>
<p>It is often useful to describe where the graph of a linear equation meets the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-axes. The point where a graph intersects the <m>x</m>-axis is called the <term><m>x</m>-intercept</term> of the graph, and the point where a graph intersects the <m>y</m>-axis it called the <term><m>y</m>-intercept</term>.</p>

<example>
<statement>
    <p>Look back at the graphs of <m>8x+4y=12</m> and <m>2y-x=8</m> from earlier in this section. What are the <m>y</m>-intercepts of each of these graphs?</p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>The <m>y</m>-intercept of <m>8x+4y=12</m> is <m>(0,4)</m>. The <m>y</m>-intercept of <m>2y-x=8</m> is <m>(0,4)</m>.</p>
</solution>
</example>

<p>It is not always clear from the graph what the intercepts of a line are. For example, consider the graph of the equation <m>6y-3x=-17</m>.</p>

    <introduction>
    <p>The set of all solutions to a linear equation in two variables can be represented on a rectangular coordinate plane using a straight line through at least two points; this line is called its graph. For example, to graph the linear equation <m>8x+4y=12</m> we would first solve for <m>y</m>.</p>

    <md>
        <mrow>8x+4y\amp = 12</mrow>
        <mrow> 4y \amp = -8x+12</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp =\frac{-8x+12}{4}</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp = \frac{-8x}{4}+\frac{12}{4}</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp = -2x+3</mrow>
    </md>

    <p>Written in this form, we can see that <m>y</m> depends on <m>x</m>; in other words, <m>x</m> is the independent variable and <m>y</m> is the dependent variable. Choose at least two <m>x</m>-values and find the corresponding <m>y</m>-values. It is a good practice to choose zero, some negative numbers, as well as some positive numbers. Here we will choose five <m>x</m> values, determine the corresponding <m>y</m>-values, and then form a representative set of ordered pair solutions.</p>

    <p>Plot the points and draw a line through the points. We add arrows on either end to indicate that the graph extends indefinitely.</p>


    <p> <image source="images/Slope1.png"><description>Quadrants of the Plane</description></image></p>

    <p>The resulting line represents all solutions to <m>8x+4y=12</m>, of which there are infinitely many. The above process describes the technique for graphing known as plotting points. This technique can be used to graph more complicated functions.</p>

    <p>The steepness of any incline can be measured as the ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change. For example, a <m>5</m>% incline can be written as <m>\frac{5}{100}</m>, which means that for every 100 feet forward, the height increases 5 feet.</p>


    <p> <image source="images/SlopePercentIncline.png"><description>Quadrants of the Plane</description></image></p>

    <p>In mathematics, we call the incline of a line the slope, denoted by the letter <m>m</m>. The vertical change is called the rise and the horizontal change is called the run. Given any two points <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> and <m>(x_2,y_2)</m>, we can obtain the rise and run by subtracting the corresponding coordinates.</p>


    <p> <image source="images/SlopeIncline.png"><description>Quadrants of the Plane</description></image></p>

    <p>This leads us to the slope formula. Given any two points <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> and <m>(x_2,y_2)</m>, the slope is given by the following formula:</p>

    <md>
        <mrow>\alert{\text{Slope }}= m=\frac{rise}{run}=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}= \alert{\frac{\text{Change in }y}{\text{Change in }x}}\text{.}</mrow></md>

    <p>The Greek letter delta <m>(\Delta)</m> is often used to describe the change in a quantity. Therefore, the slope is sometimes described using the notation <m>\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}</m>, which represents the change in <m>y</m> divided by the change in <m>x</m>.</p>

    <example><statement>
        <p>
            Find the slope of the line passing through <m>(-3, -5)</m> and <m>(2, 1)</m>.</p>
    </statement>
    <solution>

        <p>Given <m>(-3, -5)</m> and <m>(2, 1)</m>, calculate the difference of the <m>y</m>-values divided by the difference of the <m>x</m>-values. Take care to be consistent when subtracting the coordinates.</p>

        <p>Let <m>(x_1,y_1)=(-3,-5)</m> and <m>(x_2,y_2)=(2,1)</m>.</p>

        <me>
            \begin{aligned}
            m\amp = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\\
            \amp =\frac{1-(-5)}{2-(-3)}\\
            \amp =\frac{1+5}{2+3}\\
            \amp =\frac{6}{5}
            \end{aligned}
            </me>

        <p>The slope is given by <m>m=\frac{6}{5}</m>.</p>
    </solution></example>

    <p>It does not matter which point you consider to be the first and second when calculating slope. However, because subtraction is not commutative, you must take care to subtract the coordinates of the first point from the coordinates of the second point in the same order. To demonstrate this we obtain the same result in the example above if we apply the slope formula with the points switched.</p>

    <p>Let <m>(x_1,y_1)=(2,1)</m> and <m>(x_2,y_2)=(-3,-5)</m>.</p>

    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        m\amp = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\\
        \amp =\frac{-5-1}{-3-2}\\
        \amp =\frac{-6}{-5}\\
        \amp =\frac{6}{5}
        \end{aligned}
    </me>

    <p>We can verify that the slope is <m>\frac{6}{5}</m> by graphing the linear equation described in the previous example.</p>

      <p> <image source="images/Slope2.png"><description>Quadrants of the Plane</description></image></p>

    <p>Certainly the graph is optional - the beauty of the slope formula is that, given any two points, we can obtain the slope using only algebra.</p>

    <example><statement>
        <p>
            Find the <m>y</m>-value for which the slope of the line passing through <m>(6,-3)</m> and <m>(-9,y)</m> is <m>-\frac{2}{3}</m>.</p>
    </statement>
    <solution>

        <p>Substitute the given information into the slope formula.</p>

        <p>We have <m>m=-\frac{2}{3}</m> and we can let <m>(x_1,y_1)=(6,-3)</m> and <m>(x_2,y_2)=(-9,y)</m>.</p>

        <me>
            \begin{aligned}
            m\amp = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\\
            -\frac{2}{3}\amp =\frac{y-(-3)}{-9-6}\\
            -\frac{2}{3}\amp =\frac{y+3}{-15}\\
            \end{aligned}
        </me>

        <p>After substituting in the given information, the only variable left is <m>y</m>.  Solve for <m>y</m>.</p>

        <me>
            \begin{aligned}
            \alert{-15}\left(-\frac{2}{3}\right)\amp = \alert{-15}\left(-\frac{y+3}{15}\right)\\
            10\amp = y+3\\
            7\amp = y
            \end{aligned}
            </me>

        <p>The <m>y</m>-value which satisfies the conditions above is <m>y=7</m>.</p>
    </solution></example>

    <p>There are four geometric cases for the value of the slope.</p>

      <p> <image source="images/SlopeCases.png"><description>Quadrants of the Plane</description></image></p>

    <p>Reading the graph from left to right, lines with an upward incline have positive slopes and lines with a downward incline have negative slopes. The other two cases involve horizontal and vertical lines. If <m>c</m> is a real number we have</p>

        <mrow>x\amp =c \text{ whose graph is a } \alert{\text{vertical line.}}</mrow>
    </md>

    <p> For example, if we graph <m>y=2</m> we obtain a horizontal line, and if we graph <m>x=-4</m> we obtain a vertical line.</p>

    <p>From the graphs we can determine two points and calculate the slope using the slope formula.</p>

    <subsection><title>Meaning of Slope</title>

        <p>Consider the equation <m>C=4+2t</m> representing the cost of a movie rental in terms of the number of days of the rental. If we graph this equation, we can choose any two points on the line to compute its slope. For example, if we choose the points <m>(0,4)</m> and <m>(4,12)</m> then we have the following slope.</p>

        <me>m=\frac{12-4}{4-0}=\frac{8}{4}=2</me>

        <p>The slope of the line is <m>2</m>. In terms of renting a movie, our slope expression is telling us</p>

        <me>
            \frac{\text{Change in Cost}}{\text{Change in Time}}=\frac{8 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ days}}\text{.}</me>

    <p>In other words, if we were to increase the length of the rental by <m>4</m> days, the cost of the rental increases by <m>8</m> dollars. The slope gives the rate of increase in the rental fee, <m>$2</m> per day. </p>

    <p>In general, we say the slope of a line or equation measures the <term>rate of change</term> of the output variable with respect to the input variable. Depending on the units involved, this rate might be interpreted as a rate of growth or a rate of speed. A negative slope may represent a rate of decrease or a rate of consumption. The slope, or rate of change, of a graph can give us valuable information about the variables.</p>

    <example><statement>
        <p>
            Nathan went hiking and took some trail mix. After hiking <m>2.5</m> miles he had eaten <m>3</m> ounces of trail mix. On average, how many ounces of trail mix did Nathan eat per mile?
            </p></statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    The amount of trail mix that Nathan has eaten depends on how far he has hiked. This tells us that the independent variable is the distance he has hiked, in miles, and the dependent variable is the ounces of trail mix. We are looking for the average rate of change of ounces of trail mix per mile.
                </p>

                <me>\frac{\text{change in ounces of trail mix}}{\text{change in miles climbed}}=\frac{3\text{ ounces}}{2.5\text{ miles}}=1.2 \text{ ounces per mile}</me>


                <p> This tells us that Nathan ate <m>1.2</m> ounces of trail mix per mile on his hike.</p>

    <subsection><title>Linear Functions</title>

        <p>Given any linear equation in standard form, <m>ax+by=c,</m> we can solve for <m>y</m> to obtain <term>slope-intercept form</term>, <m>y=mx+b</m>. For example,</p>

        <md>
            <mrow>3x-4y\amp =8</mrow>
            <mrow>-4y\amp = -3x+8</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp =\frac{-3x+8}{-4}</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp = \frac{-3x}{-4}+\frac{8}{-4}</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp = \frac{3}{4}x-2\text{.}</mrow>
        </md>

        <p>Where <m>x=0</m>, we can see that <m>y=-2</m> and thus <m>(0,-2)</m> is an ordered pair solution. This is the point where the graph intersects the <m>y</m>-axis and is called the <term><m>y</m>-intercept</term>. We can use this point and the slope as a means to quickly graph a linear equation. For example, to graph <m>y=\frac{3}{4}x-2</m>, start at the <m>y</m>-intercept <m>(0,-2)</m> and mark off the slope to find a second point. Then use these points to graph the linear equation as follows:</p>

          <p> <image source="images/Slope4.png"><description>Quadrants of the Plane</description></image></p>

        <p>Since this graph passes the vertical line test, this graph represents a function. Furthermore, the domain and range consist of all real numbers.</p>

          <p> <image source="images/Slope5.png"><description>Quadrants of the Plane</description></image></p>

        <p>In general, a <term>linear function</term> is a function that can be written in the form</p>

        <md>
            <mrow> f(x)=mx+b </mrow>
        </md>

        <p>where the slope <m>m</m> and <m>b</m> represent any real numbers. Since <m>y=f(x)</m>, we can use <m>y</m> and <m>f(x)</m> interchangeably to represent the output, and ordered pair solutions on the graph <m>(x,y)</m> can be written in the form <m>(x,f(x))</m>.</p>

        <p>We know that any <m>y</m>-intercept of a graph will have an <m>x</m>-value equal to zero. Therefore, the <m>y</m>-intercept of a function <m>f</m> can be expressed as the ordered pair <m>(0,f(0))</m>. For linear functions,</p>

        <md>
            <mrow>f(\alert{0})=m(\alert{0})+b=b\text{.}</mrow>
        </md>

        <p>Hence the <m>y</m>-intercept of the graph of any linear function is <m>(0,b)</m>. To find the <term><m>x</m>-intercepts</term>, the points where the graph of the function intersects the <m>x</m>-axis, we find <m>x</m> where <m>y=0</m> or <m>f(x)=0</m>.  It is possible for a function to have no <m>x</m>-intercepts.</p>

        <example><statement>
            <p>
                Graph the linear function <m>f(x)=-\frac{5}{3}x+6</m> and label the <m>x</m>-intercept.</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>

            <p>From the function, we see that <m>f(0)=6</m> (or <m>b=6</m>) and thus the <m>y</m>-intercept of the graph is <m>(0, 6)</m>. Also, we can see that the slope is <m>m=-\frac{5}{3}=\frac{-5}{3}=\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}</m>. Starting from the <m>y</m>-intercept, mark a second point down <m>5</m> units and right <m>3</m> units. Draw the line passing through these two points.</p>

        <p>We can use the ideas in this section to develop a geometric understanding of what it means to solve equations of the form <m>f(x)=g(x)</m>, where <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are linear functions. Using algebra, we can solve the linear equation <m>\frac{1}{2}x+1=3</m> as follows:</p>

        <md>
            <mrow> \frac{1}{2}x+1\amp =3</mrow>

        </md>

        <p>The solution to this equation is <m>x=4</m>. Geometrically, this is the <m>x</m>-value of the intersection of the two graphs <m>f(x)=\frac{1}{2}x+1</m> and <m>g(x)=3</m>. The idea is to graph the two linear functions and determine where the graphs coincide.</p>

        <example><statement>
            <p>
                Graph <m>f(x)=\frac{1}{2}x+1</m> and <m>g(x)=3</m> on the same set of axes and determine where <m>f(x)=g(x)</m>.</p>

        </statement>

            <p>Here <m>f</m> is a linear function with slope <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> and its graph has <m>y</m>-intercept <m>(0,1)</m>. The function <m>g</m> is represented by a horizontal line. Graph both of these functions on the same set of axes.</p>

              <p> <image source="images/GraphInterpretation1.png"><description>Quadrants of the Plane</description></image></p>

            <p> From the graph we can see that <m>f(x)=g(x)</m> where <m>x=4</m>. In other words, <m>\frac{1}{2}x+1=3</m> where <m>x=4</m>.</p>

        </solution></example>


        <p>We can extend the geometric interpretation a bit further to solve inequalities. For example, we can solve the linear inequality <m>\frac{1}{2}x+1\geq 3</m>, as follows:</p>

        <md>
            <mrow>\frac{1}{2}x+1 \amp\geq 3</mrow>

        </md>

        <p>The solution set consists of all real numbers greater than or equal to 4. Geometrically, these are the <m>x</m>-values for which the graph <m>f(x)=\frac{1}{2}x+1</m> lies above the graph of <m>g(x)=3</m>.</p>

        <example><statement>
            <p>Graph <m>f(x)=\frac{1}{2}x+1</m> and <m>g(x)=3</m> on the same set of axes and determine where <m>f(x)\geq g(x)</m>.

<subsection><title>Equations of Lines</title>

<p>Given the algebraic equation of a line, we can graph it in a number of ways. In this section, we will be given a geometric description of a line and find the algebraic equation. Finding an equation of a line can be accomplished in a number of ways. The following example makes use of slope-intercept form, <m>y=mx+b</m>, or using function notation, <m>f(x)=mx+b</m>. If we can determine the slope, <m>m</m>, and the <m>y</m>-intercept, <m>(0,b)</m>, we can then construct an equation.</p>

<example>
<statement>
    <p>Find an equation of the line passing through <m>(-3,6)</m> and <m>(5,-4)</m>.</p>
</statement>
<solution>
    <p>We begin by finding the slope. Given two points, we can find the slope using the slope formula.</p>

    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        m\amp = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\\
        \amp =\frac{-4-(6)}{5-(-3)}\\
        \amp =\frac{-4-6}{5+3}\\
        \amp =\frac{-10}{8}\\
        \amp = -\frac{5}{4}
        \end{aligned}
    </me>

    <p>Here <m>m=-\frac{5}{4}</m> and we have</p>

    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        f(x)\amp =mx+b\\
        f(x)\amp = -\frac{5}{4}x+b.
        \end{aligned}
    </me>

    <p>To find <m>b</m>, substitute either one of the given points through which the line passes. Here we will use <m>(-3,6)</m>, but <m>(5,-4)</m> would work just as well:</p>

    <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        f(x)\amp = -\frac{5}{4}x+b\amp \alert{\text{Use }(x,f(x))=(-3,6)}\\
        \alert{6}\amp = -\frac{5}{4}(\alert{-3})+b\\
                6\amp =\frac{15}{4}+b\\
                \frac{6\cdot \alert{4}}{1\cdot\alert{4}}-\frac{15}{4}\amp =b\\
                \frac{24-15}{4}\amp =b\\
                \frac{9}{4}\amp =b
                \end{aligned}
            </me>

            <p>
                Therefore, the equation of the line passing through the two given points is <m>f(x)=mx+b=-\frac{5}{4}x+\frac{9}{4}</m>.</p>
        </solution></example>

        <p>Next, we outline an alternative method for finding equations of lines. Begin by applying the slope formula with a given point <m>(x_1,y_1)</m> and a variable point <m>(x,y)</m>.</p>

        <md>
            <mrow> m\amp =\frac{y-y_1}{x-x_1}</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{m}{1}\amp =\frac{y-y_1}{x-x_1}</mrow>
            <mrow>m(x-x_1)\amp = y-y_1</mrow>
            <mrow>y-y_1\amp = m(x-x_1)</mrow>
        </md>

        <p>Therefore, the equation of a nonvertical line can be written in <term>point-slope form</term>:</p>

        <md>
            <mrow> y-y_1=m(x-x_1)</mrow>
        </md>

        <p>Point-slope form is particularly useful for finding an equation of a line given the slope and any ordered pair solution. After finding the slope, <m>-\frac{5}{4}</m> in the previous example, we could use this form to find an equation. Using the point <m>(-3,6)</m>, we substitute as follows:</p>

        <md>
            <mrow>y-y_1\amp =m(x-x_1)</mrow>
            <mrow>y-(\alert{6})\amp =\alert{-\frac{5}{4}}(x-(\alert{-3}))</mrow>
            <mrow>y-6\amp =-\frac{5}{4}(x+3)</mrow>
            <mrow>y-6\amp=-\frac{5}{4}x-\frac{15}{4}</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp =-\frac{5}{4}x-\frac{15}{4}+6</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp =-\frac{5}{4}x+\frac{9}{4}</mrow>
        </md>

        <p>Notice that we obtain the same linear function <m>f(x)=-\frac{5}{4}x+\frac{9}{4}</m>.</p>

        <p>Note: Sometimes a variable is not expressed explicitly in terms of another; however, it is still assumed that one variable is dependent on the other. For example, the equation <m>2x+3y=6</m> implicitly represents the function <m>f(x)=-\frac{2}{3}x+2</m>. You should become comfortable with working with functions in either form.</p>

        <example><statement>
            <p>Find an equation of the following linear function:
            </p>

        </statement>
        <solution>

            <p>From the graph we can determine two points <m>(-1, -2)</m> and <m>(4, 1)</m>. Use these points to read the slope from the graph. The rise is <m>3</m> units and the run is <m>5</m> units.</p>

              <p> <image source="images/Modeling2.png"><description>Quadrants of the Plane</description></image></p>

                <p>Therefore, we have the slope and a point. (It does not matter which of the given points we use, the result will be the same.) We will use the point <m>(-1,-2)</m> with our slope <m>m=\frac{3}{5}</m>.</p>

            <p>We will use point-slope form to determine an equation of the line.</p>

    <subsection><title>Elementary Functions</title>
        <p>In this section we graph two elementary functions that will be used throughout this course. Each function is graphed by plotting points. For this course <m>f(x)=y</m> and thus <m>f(x)</m> and <m>y</m> can be used interchangeably.</p>

        <p>Any function of the form <m>f(x)=c</m>, where <m>c</m> is any real number, is called a <term>constant function</term>. Constant functions are linear and can be written in the form <m>f(x)=0x+c</m>. In this form, it is clear that the slope is 0 and the <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0,c)</m>. Evaluating any value for <m>x</m>, such as <m>x=2</m>, will result in <m>c</m>.</p>

       <p> <image source="images/ElementaryFunction.png"><description>Quadrants of the Plane</description></image></p>

        <p>The graph of a constant function is a horizontal line. The domain consists of all real numbers <m>\mathbb{R}=(-\infty,\infty)</m> and the range consists of the single value <m>{c}</m>.</p>

        <p>We next define the <term>identity function</term> <m>f(x)=x</m>. Evaluating any value for <m>x</m> will result in the same value. For example, <m>f(0)=0</m> and <m>f(2)=2</m>. The identity function is linear, <m>f(x)=1x+0</m>, with slope <m>m=1</m> and <m>y</m>-intercept <m>(0,0)</m>.</p>

        <p> <image source="images/IdentityFunction.png"><description>Quadrants of the Plane</description></image></p>

        <p>The domain and range both consist of all real numbers, <m>\mathbb{R}=(-\infty,\infty)</m>.</p>
