      So far,
      we have used the words
      <em>increasing</em> and <em>decreasing</em> intuitively
      to describe a function's graph.
      Here we define these terms more formally.

      Simply put,
      an increasing function is one that is rising as we move from left to right along the graph,
      and a decreasing function is one that falls as the value of the input increases.
     </p>
<p permid="YsX">
      Given a differentiable function <m>y= f(x)</m>,
      we know that its derivative, <m>y = f'(x)</m>,
      is a related function whose output at <m>x=a</m> tells us the slope of the tangent line to
      <m>y = f(x)</m> at the point <m>(a,f(a))</m>.
      That is, <m>y</m>-coordinates on the derivative graph tell us the values of slopes on the original function's graph.
    </p>

    <p permid="EAg">
      At a point where <m>f'(x)</m> is positive,
      the slope of the tangent line to <m>f</m> is positive.
      Therefore, on an interval where <m>f'(x)</m> is positive,
      the function <m>f</m> is increasing
      (or rising).
          <idx><h>increasing</h></idx>
      Similarly,
      if <m>f'(x)</m> is negative on an interval,
      the graph of <m>f</m> is decreasing
          <idx><h>decreasing</h></idx>
      (or falling).
    </p>

    <p permid="kHp">
      The derivative of <m>f</m> tells us not only <em>whether</em>
      the function <m>f</m> is increasing or decreasing on an interval,
      but also <em>how</em> the function <m>f</m> is increasing or decreasing.
      Look at the two tangent lines shown below in <xref ref="F-1-6-Intro">Figure</xref>.
      We see that at point <m>A</m>
      the value of <m>f'(x)</m> is positive and relatively close to zero,
      and at that point the graph is rising slowly.
      By contrast, at point <m>B</m>,
      the derivative is negative and relatively large in absolute value,
      and <m>f</m> is decreasing rapidly at <m>B</m>.

<p permid="Vyr">
      Let <m>f</m> be a function that is differentiable on an interval <m>(a,b)</m>.
      If the function <m>f</m> is increasing on <m>(a,b)</m> then
      <m>f'(x) \geq 0</m> for every <m>x</m> in the interval <m>(a, b)</m>.
      Conversely, if <m>f'(x) > 0</m> for every <m>x</m> in the interval, then
      the function <m>f</m> must be increasing on the interval.
      Notice that we have to have the derivative strictly positive to conclude that the function is increasing.
      Letting <m>f</m> be a constant function shows that if the derivative can be zero, then the function
      need not be increasing.  Also, knowing the function is increasing is not enough to conclude that the 
      derivative is positive.  The function <m>f(x)=x^3</m> is increasing on <m>(-1,1)</m> but <m>f'(0)=0</m>.
</p>
<p>
      Similarly, if the function <m>f</m> is decreasing on <m>(a,b)</m> then
      <m>f'(x) \leq 0</m> for every <m>x</m> in the interval <m>(a, b)</m>.
      Conversely, if <m>f'(x) \lt 0</m> for every <m>x</m> in the interval, then
      the function <m>f</m> must be decreasing on the interval.
  </p>

    <p permid="BFA">
      For example,
      the function pictured below in <xref ref="F-1-6-Intro2">Figure</xref>
      is increasing on the entire interval <m>-2 \lt x \lt 0</m>.
      Note that at both <m>x = \pm 2</m> and <m>x = 0</m>,
      we say that <m>f</m> is neither increasing nor decreasing,
      because <m>f'(x) = 0</m> at these values.

    <p>
    The graph shows that <m>h(x)\le-1=h(-2)</m> for every <m>x</m> near <m>-2</m> and 
    <m>h(x)\le2=h(1)</m> for every <m>x</m> near <m>1</m>. We notice that these are points where <m>h</m>
    switches from increasing to decreasing. Since there are no other points on the graph where the 
    <m>y</m>-coordinate is larger than everything nearby, it follows that the only relative 
    maxima of <m>h</m> on this domain occur at <m>c=-2</m> and <m>c=1</m>.
    </p>
    </li>

    <li>
    <p>
    The graph shows that <m>h(x)\ge-2=h(0)</m> for every <m>x</m> near <m>0</m>, a point where 
    <m>h</m> switches from decreasing to increasing. Since this is the only point shown where this occurs, 
    we say that the only relative minimum of <m>h</m> on this domain occurs at <m>c=0</m>.
    <!--However, because we are looking at a restricted domain, 
    on the left we see that <m>h</m> starts out by going up, so <m>h(x)\ge-3=h(-3)</m> for every <m>x</m> near to 
    (and greater than) <m>-3</m>. Similarly, on the right we see that <m>h</m> finishes by going down, 
    so <m>h(x)\ge-1.25=h(3)</m> for all <m>x</m> near to (and less than) <m>3</m>. At the very least, then, 
    we can say that the relative minima of <m>h</m> <em>on the domain <m>[-3,3]</m></em> are 
    <m>c=-3</m>, <m>c=0</m>, and <m>c=3</m>. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Again, we emphasize that the endpoints of the domain are special. If the graph extended to either side, 
    we could not say with certainty whether the points <m>(-3,h(-3))</m> and <m>(3,h(3))</m> are relative minima or not.
    They might be, if the graph changed direction again, but they would not be if the graph followed the existing trend. -->
    </p>
    </li>

    <li>
    <p>
    Recall that <m>h'(c)</m> only exists when all of the following are true:
    <ul>
    <li><p><m>h(c)</m> is defined,</p></li>
    <li><p><m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to c}h(x)</m> exists,</p></li>
    <li><p><m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to c}h(x)=h(c)</m>, and </p></li>
    <li><p><m>\displaystyle \lim_{a\to0}\frac{h(c+a)-h(c)}a</m> exists.</p></li>
    </ul>
    Assuming <m>h</m> is continuous at <m>c</m> (i.e. the first three points hold), 
    the main consequence of the final point is that a corner or a cusp at <m>(c,h(c))</m> 
    makes <m>h</m> nondifferentiable at <m>c</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
    With all this in mind, we can say that <m>h'(c)</m> does not exist at <m>c=-2</m>, <m>c=0</m>, or <m>c=1.5</m>
    because <m>h</m> has a cusp at these points. 
    <!-- Moreover, <m>h'(-3)</m> does not exist because 
    <m>\displaystyle \lim_{a\to0^-}\frac{h(-3+a)-h(-3)}a</m> is undefined, and <m>h'(3)</m> does not 
    exist because <m>\displaystyle \lim_{a\to0^+}\frac{h(3+a)-h(3)}a</m> is undefined.-->
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    This is true. Every relative extremum of <m>h</m> occurs at a point where <m>h'(c)</m>
    is either zero or does not exist. 
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>
    This is false. Some points at which <m>h'(c)</m> is zero or undefined are not relative extrema. 
    In particular, <m>h'(-2.5)</m> is zero, but the graph is non-decreasing near <m>(-2.5,-2)</m>. 
    Similarly, <m>h'(1.5)</m> is undefined, but the graph is non-increasing near <m>(1.5,1)</m>.
    Neither of these points is a relative maximum or minimum.

<example>
<statement>
<p>
Consider the function <m>s(t) = -16t^2 + 24t + 32</m> (shown on the <em>left</em> of <xref ref="F-3-1-Intro">Figure</xref>). To find the relative extrema:
</p>
<p>
<em>Step 1</em> Find the derivative of <m>s(t)</m>.
<me>
s'(t)=-32t+24
</me>
<em>Step 2</em> Find any critical points of <m>s(t)</m> by setting <m>s'(t)=0</m> and solving for <m>t</m> and considering when <m>s'(t)=DNE</m>.
<me>
s'(t)=-32t+24=0 \text{ solve by adding } 32t \text{ to both side and dividing by } 24 \text{ to get}  t=\frac{24}{32}=\frac{3}{4}
</me>
Thus we found a single critical point <m>t=\frac{3}{4}</m>. In this case the derivative always exists.</p>
<p>
<em>Step 3</em> Consider the sign of the derivative on either side of the critical point to determine if the function is increasing or decreasing. In this case <m>s'(0)=24\gt0</m>, thus <m>s(t)</m> is increasing to the left of the critical point. Also <m>s'(1)=-8\lt0</m>, thus <m>s(t)</m> is decreasing from the right of critical point.
</p>
<p>
<em>Step 4</em> Interpret your results from Step 3. Here since the function goes from increasing to decreasing at <m>t=\frac{3}{4}</m> the function has a relative maximum at <m>(\frac{3}{4},s(\frac{3}{4}))</m> (shown on the <em>left</em> of <xref ref="F-3-1-Intro">Figure</xref>).
</p>
</statement>
</example>

<example>
<statement>
<p>
Consider the function <m>f(x) =2x^3-3x^2-12x+1</m>, find the relative extrema:
</p>
<p>
<em>Step 1</em> Find the derivative of <m>f(x)</m>.
<me>
f'(x)=6x^2-6x-12
</me>
<em>Step 2</em> Find any critical points of <m>f(x)</m> by setting <m>f'(x)=0</m> and solving for <m>x</m> and considering when <m>f'(x)=DNE</m>.
<me>
f'(x)=6x^2-6x-12=0 \text{ solve by factoring } f'(x)=6(x^2-x-2)=6(x-2)(x+1)=0
</me>
Thus we find two critical points <m>x=2,-1</m>. The derivative always exists.</p>
<p>
<em>Step 3</em> Consider the sign of the derivative on either side of the critical points to determine if the function is increasing or decreasing. In this case we need to test the sign at three points: <m>f'(-2)=24\gt0</m>, thus <m>f(x)</m> is increasing when <m>x\lt-1</m>; <m>f(0)=-12\lt0</m>, thus <m>f(x)</m> is decreasing for <m> -1 \lt x \lt 2</m>; and <m>f'(3)=24\gt0</m>, thus <m>f(x)</m> is increasing for <m>x\gt 2</m>.
</p>
<p>
<em>Step 4</em> Interpret your results from Step 3. Since <m>f(x)</m> goes from  increasing to decreasing at <m>x=-1</m> <m>f(x)</m> has a relative maximum at <m>(-1,f(-1))</m>. Since <m>f(x)</m> goes from decreasing to increasing at <m>x=2</m> <m>f(x)</m> has a relative minimum  at <m>(2,f(2))</m>.

          Since we already have <m>f'(x)</m> written in factored form,
          it is straightforward to find the critical numbers of <m>f</m>.
          Because <m>f'(x)</m> is defined for all values of <m>x</m>,
          we need only determine where <m>f'(x) = 0</m>.
          From the equation
          <me permid="Afi">
            e^{-2x}(3-x)(x+1)^2 = 0
          </me>
          and the zero product property<fn>
          The zero product property says that if <m>ab=0</m>, where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are 
          expressions representing real numbers (e.g. <m>a=(3-x)</m>, where <m>x</m> is a real number), 
          then it must be the case that <m>a=0</m> or <m>b=0</m> (or both). 
          </fn>,
          it follows that <m>x = 3</m> and <m>x = -1</m> are critical numbers of <m>f</m>.
          (There is no value of <m>x</m> that makes <m>e^{-2x} = 0</m>.)
        </p>

        <p permid="CpU">
          Next, to apply the first derivative test,
          we'd like to know the sign of <m>f'(x)</m> at inputs near the critical numbers.
          Because the critical numbers are the only locations at which <m>f'</m> can change sign,
          it follows that the sign of the derivative is the same on each of the intervals created by the critical numbers:
          for instance,
          the sign of <m>f'</m> must be the same for every <m>x \lt -1</m>.
          What this means is that we can choose (carefully) where to evaluate the derivative 
          in order to ascertain its sign on a given interval. Since <m>f'(-1.000001)</m> and 
          <m>f'(-2)</m> must have the same sign, we may as well evaluate <m>f'(x)</m> at <m>-2</m>
          to figure out the sign of <m>f'</m> for <m>x\lt -1</m>. 
          We create a first derivative sign chart (displayed below, with explanation following) 
          to summarize the sign of <m>f'</m> on the relevant intervals,
          along with the corresponding behavior of <m>f</m>.

        </figure>

        <p permid="ixd">
          To produce the first derivative sign chart in <xref ref="F-3-1-signchart">Figure</xref>, 
          we start by marking the critical numbers <m>-1</m> and <m>3</m> on the number line.
          We then identify the sign of each factor of <m>f'(x)</m> at one selected point in each interval.
          The intervals in this example are <m>x\lt-1</m>, <m>-1\lt x\lt3</m>, and <m>x\gt3</m>; we will choose 
          <m>x=-2</m>, <m>x=0</m>, and <m>x=5</m> for our selected points. The process with <m>x=-2</m> is laid out below:
        </p>
        <p>
          For <m>x \lt -1</m>,
          we use the value <m>x=-2</m> to determine the sign of <m>e^{-2x}</m>,
          <m>(3-x)</m>, and <m>(x+1)^2</m>.
          We note that <m>e^{-2x}</m> is positive regardless of the value of <m>x</m>, 
          <m>(x+1)^2</m> is positive whenever it is nonzero <mdash /> which is everywhere 
          within the intervals of interest since we intentionally plucked out the zeros <mdash />
          and that <m>(3-x)</m> is also positive at <m>x = -2</m>.
          Hence each of the three terms in <m>f'</m> is positive,
          and we indicate this by writing <q><m>+++</m></q> above the interval <m>x\lt-1</m>.
          Taking the product of three positive terms results in a positive value for <m>f'</m>,
          so we denote the sign of <m>f'</m> by a <q><m>+</m></q> above the appropriate interval in the chart. 
          Finally, since <m>f'</m> is positive on that interval,
          we know that <m>f</m> is increasing,
          so we write <q>INC</q>
          to represent the behavior of <m>f</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a similar fashion,
          we find that <m>f'</m> is positive (because <m>3-(0)\gt0</m> and the other terms are also still positive) and <m>f</m> is increasing on <m>-1 \lt x \lt 3</m>,
          and that <m>f'</m> is negative (because <m>3-(5)\lt0</m> but the other terms are still positive) and <m>f</m> is decreasing for <m>x \gt 3</m>.
        </p>

        <p permid="OEm">
          Now we look for critical numbers at which <m>f'</m> changes sign.
          In this example, <m>f'</m> changes sign only at <m>x = 3</m>,
          from positive to negative,
          so <m>f</m> has a relative maximum at <m>x = 3</m>.
          Although <m>f</m> has a critical number at <m>x = -1</m>,
          since <m>f</m> is increasing both before and after <m>x = -1</m>,
          <m>f</m> has neither a minimum nor a maximum at <m>x = -1</m>.

              Based on where <m>f'(x)</m> has horizontal tangent lines and where its slope is positive and negative,
              we can sketch an approximate graph of
              <m>y = f''(x)</m> in the usual way that we sketch the derivative of a given function.
              From the given graph of <m>y = f'(x)</m>,
              we can see that <m>f''(x) = 0</m> at <m>x \approx -0.35</m> and at <m>x = 1</m>,
              and that between these points,

              while <m>f''(x)</m> is positive everywhere else since <m>f'(x)</m> is increasing everywhere else.

              From our sketch of the second derivative in (b),

              In particular, we saw that
              <m>f''(x) = 0</m> at <m>x \approx -0.35</m> and at <m>x = 1</m>,
              and that between these points,
              <m>f''(x)</m> is negative, while <m>f''(x)</m> is positive everywhere else.
              This shows that <m>f</m> is concave down for
              <m>-0.35 \lt x \lt 1</m> while being concave up everywhere else.
              We thus see that <m>f</m> has points of inflection at both <m>x \approx -0.35</m> and <m>x = 1</m>.

              we can sketch an approximate graph of <m>y = f(x)</m>.
              Note that we also know <m>f</m> has a horizontal tangent line at <m>x = 1</m> while being increasing on either side of <m>x = 1</m>,

              Note that <m>p''(x)=0</m> at <m>x=-1</m> and <m>x=2</m>.
              The second derivative sign chart for <m>p</m> shows that <m>p''(x)</m> is negative for
              <m>-1 \lt x \lt 2</m> and positive for all other values of <m>x</m>.
              Since <m>p''</m> changes sign at <m>x = -1</m> and <m>x = 2</m>,
              <m>p</m> has points of inflection at <m>x = -1</m> and <m>x = 2</m>.
              In particular, <m>p</m> is concave down for
              <m>-1 \lt x \lt 2</m> and concave up for all other values of <m>x</m>.

              If we compute <m>p''\left(\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2} \right)</m>,
              we find that <m>p''\left(\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2} \right) \approx -1.205</m>,
              which means that <m>p</m> is concave down at <m>x = \frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}</m>.
              Since <m>p</m> has a horizontal tangent line at this point,
              it follows that <m>p</m> has a relative maximum at
              <m>x = \frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}</m> by the second derivative test.

              Since <m>p(2) = \frac{12}{e^2}</m> and <m>p'(2) = -\frac{5}{e^2}</m>,
              the equation of the tangent line to <m>p</m> at <m>x = 2</m> is given by <m>y = -\frac{5}{e^2}(x-2) + \frac{12}{e^2}</m>.
              To determine whether the tangent line lies above or below the graph of <m>y=p(x)</m> at <m>x = 2</m>,
              we consider the concavity of <m>p</m>.
              Recall we know that <m>p''(2) = 0</m> and that <m>p</m> is concave down to the left of <m>x = 2</m> and concave up to the right.
              Thus, the tangent line lies neither solely below nor solely above the graph of <m>y = p(x)</m> at <m>x = 2</m>;
              it lies below <m>y = p(x)</m> to the right of <m>x = 2</m> and above
              <m>y = p(x)</m> to the left of <m>x = 2</m>.
